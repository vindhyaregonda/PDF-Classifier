Introduction
The all new VCPGX LED (Visually Comfortable Parking 
Garage) luminaire is the ultimate solution for parking 
garage applications. The deep recessed lens design of 
VCPGX LED minimizes high angle glare, while its patent 
pending transition zone reduces the contrast ratio between 
the luminaire and the dark ceiling. The dedicated up-light 
module option further reduces this contrast, creating a 
more visually comfortable environment.
The VCPGX LED delivers up to 87% in energy savings 
when replacing 175W metal halide luminaires. With over 
100,000 hour life expectancy (12+ years of 24/7 continuous 
operation), the VCPGX LED luminaire provides significant 
maintenance savings over traditional luminaires.

Introduction
The new RSX LED Area family delivers maximum 
value by providing significant energy savings, long 
life and outstanding photometric performance at an 
affordable price. The RSX4 delivers 40,000 to 70,000 
lumens allowing it to replace up to (2) 1000W HID 
luminaires.
The RSX features an integral universal mounting 
mechanism that allows the luminaire to be mounted 
on most existing drill hole patterns. This “no-drill” 
solution provides significant labor savings. An 
easy-access door on the bottom of mounting arm 
allows for wiring without opening the electrical 
compartment. A mast arm adaptor, adjustable 
integral slipfitter and other mounting configurations 
are available.

Cove
TruGroove cove offers a highly controlled asymmetric light throw, evenly lighting 
the space and ceiling, not the wall and pocket. This creates a smoothly illuminated 
low-glare environment with a ""quiet"" ceiling, free of striations. By adjusting 
installation angles you can determine your distribution, and multiple lumen-
package choices help you direct the right amount of light within your space. 
TruGroove cove now includes AccuRender technology for the highest 
color quality at the highest efficacy.

The Veil Series
Like a thin and delicate piece of fabric, Veil softens, 
warms and enhances light. A flexible, translucent PVC 
membrane provides the shielding that gently scatters 
light to give Veil its superior diffusing qualities.
The almost sky-like light warms the appearance of inte-
rior environments, and with its wide range of standard 
and custom sizes, Veil is able to provide soft volumetric 
illumination for almost any room.

The 3AG Slo-Blo® fuse solves a broad range of application 
requirements while offering reliable performance and cost-
effective circuit protection. 
The fuse catalog number with the suffix “ID” instantly 
identifies itself upon opening by showing a discoloration 
of its glass body. Guesswork and time consuming circuit 
testing are eliminated. This unique design offers the same 
quality performance characteristics as the standard 3AG 
Slo-Blo® Fuse design.
