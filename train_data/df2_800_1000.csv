SCOPE
SCOPE
This specification covers inspection methods, procedures and requirements for high-frequency
and controlled electrical cables.
TEMPERATURE RATING
The temperature rating, when shown on the specification sheet, is based on data obtained from
either testing of the insulation material(s) using the mechanical and electrical integrity of the
product as defined by ASTM D 3032, Section 14, as the basis for the rating, or by industry-
defined standards for the type of material.  The temperature rating is not based on possible
changes to the electrical characteristics of the cable which might occur as a result of exposure
to temperature extremes.

05 JAN 15  Rev C
NOTE 
All numerical values are in metric units [with U.S. customary units in brackets]. Dimensions are in millimeters. Unless 
otherwise specified, dimensions have a tolerance of ±0.13 mm and angles have a tolerance of ±2°. Figures and illustrations 
are for identification only and are not drawn to scale.  
1. INTRODUCTION 
This specification covers the Inverted Thru Board Platform for both Card Edge and Poke-In Applications. In 
both cases, power can be routed to the LEDs on a printed circuit (pc) board thru the pc board via these 
connector families. The Card Edge version allows the mating of a LED driver pc board perpendicular to the 
LED pc board. The Poke-In version allows discrete wires ranging from 26 AWG to 18 AWG to poke into the 
bottom of the connector. The low-profile flat top design minimizes interference of the light cone from the 
adjacent LEDs, and provides a convenient pick up location for automated pick-and-place machinery. The 
connectors share a common pc board footprint and are packaged in tape and reel per EIA-481. 
When corresponding with TE Connectivity (TE) Personnel, use the terminology provided in this specification to 
facilitate your inquiries for information. Basic terms and features of this product are provided in Figure 1.

KYOCERA AVX continues to develop unique connectors to fill the gap in the industrial 
market, specifically as it relates to low pin count requirements. The newest addition 
to KYOCERA AVX’s broadening line of one piece card edge connectors is the 2p-6p 
top entry version which complements the bottom entry version released last year. 
This new configuration will allow small perpendicular daughter cards to be plugged in 
from the top side of the main board. The single connector option offers an alternative 
to the more traditional and costly two piece solution.
This small connector is packed with several key features that provide significant 
functionality in a broad range of robust industrial applications. The contact system is 
gold plated for enhanced reliability, signal integrity and full 2A/contact current rating. 
The PCB board opening is dual slotted to accept either a 0.8mm or 1.6mm thick 
daughter card within the same connector body.

APPLICATIONS
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
ELECTRICAL
ENVIRONMENTAL
MECHANICAL
KYOCERA AVX developed the 9159 Series of SMT connectors for co-planar PCB 
mating for the challenging Solid State Lighting (SSL) market. These connectors 
needed to be small, low in height, carry up to 5 Amps/contact, and then function up to 
125°C for extended periods. This application has been very unique to the SSL market 
where PCB’s are stacked end-to-end to create linear strip lighting in everything from 
office to transportation applications.
The IDC cable socket connector allows for 22-24AWG discrete or cabled wires to be 
easily and reliably terminated into a 9159 standard interface plug connector. This will 
allow power and signals to be connected onto a PCB socket connector while providing 
positive latching. The wire assembly support block allows for 2 through 6 wires to be 
terminated all in one step with any standard bench top press. IDC covers provide both 
through (daisy chain applications) and wire stop termination options.

KYOCERA AVX developed the 9159 Series of SMT connectors for co-planar PCB 
mating for the challenging Solid State Lighting (SSL) market. These connectors 
needed to be small, low in height, carry up to 5 Amps/contact and then function up to 
125C for extended periods. This application has been very unique to the SSL market 
where PCB’s are stacked end-to-end to create linear strip lighting in everything from 
office to transportation applications where products are exposed to harsh mechanical 
and environmental environments.
This vertical  plug  connector opens  up  the spectrum  to  include all commercial, 
industrial and transportation applications requiring perpendicular PCB mating and 
latching Wire-to-Board cabled sockets with an already proven connector system. With 
sizes from 2p-6p, these gold plated contacts mate with high spring  force beryllium 
copper receptacle  connectors.

KYOCERA AVX was challenged with increasing the pin count density as well as 
minimizing the size of the existing coplanar BTB card edge connector for linear strip 
lighting. The current product is a 2.0mm with single contacts that straddle the PCB to 
make electrical connection on both the top and bottom side of the board. By simply 
changing the contacts to a double sided configuration (separate contacts for both the 
top and bottom of the PCB), KYOCERA AVX was able to double the pin count in the 
same 2.0mm pitch with minimal to no impact on the electrical performance of the 
connector. Reducing the size of the connector required a complete new design as the 
target was a 4p connector with a total length of 4.0mm. To achieve this, KYOCERA 
AVX removed the end walls and then added a center support/keying rib to pre-align the 
PCB during mating. This rib the then holds the PCB in the proper functional location.
The new family of connectors is available with contact sizes of 4, 6, 8 and 10 positions, 
doubling the current products range. The current rating will be 3A for the 4p and 6p, 
and then drop to 2.5A for the 8p and 10p connector. The connector supports the 
standard 1.6mm PCB thickness.
This new connector provides the highest density to reliably connect two in-line 
PCB’s together in the most cost effective assembled solution. More importantly, the 
increased pin count allows for more flexibility in mixing and matching power and 
signal lines.

/ BUCHANAN WIREMATE ITB RELEASABLE POKE-IN CONNECTORS
Inverted Thru-Board (ITB) connectors join the BUCHANAN WireMate family from TE 
Connectivity (TE), specially designed for use in linear and circular LED modules found 
in all sorts of commercial and industrial lighting systems. The unique headers enable 
power delivery from the underside of the PCB and LED arrays, eliminating top-surface 
wire management issues. With their easy-to-use poke-in and wire release features, the 
new connectors help shorten installation time and provide extra flexibility for reuse 
and wire replacement. The reduced profile of the connector takes only 2mm in height 
above the PCB top surface while horizontal wire insertion minimizes space usage 
beneath the PCB. The connectors are modular in design, available for up to five wire 
connections and in different colors to help installers avoid mistakes when inserting 
wires. The connectors conform to the UL 1977 standard for component connectors for 
use in data, signal, control and power applications.

APPLICATIONS
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
ELECTRICAL
ENVIRONMENTAL
MECHANICAL
KYOCERA AVX has developed the 1-Piece bottom entry card edge connector to allow 
a perpendicular PCB to be mated to a top mounted main FR4 or metal core PCB from 
the bottom side. The most popular application on the market is in the LED bulb market 
where the FR4 driver card needs to mate to the top pads on a metal core LED board. 
A unique design feature of the KYOCERA AVX connector is that it allows for both 
a 1.6mm and 0.8mm mating PCB thickness, giving designers flexibility in their PCB 
layout and selection. The additional “Anti-Touch” cap can be ordered pre-assembled 
onto the connector or separately. This component protects an individual for electrical 
contact if the lens comes off or the bulb is broken. This is a UL mandated safety 
requirement.
The connectors offer a range of 2 positions to 6 positions in order to add additional 
functionality in the application design such as color control or specific control lines. 
The connector is UL rated with halogen free material and capable of operating 
temperatures up to 120ºC.

APPLICATIONS
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
ELECTRICAL
ENVIRONMENTAL
MECHANICAL
KYOCERA AVX developed the 9159 Series of SMT connectors for co-planar PCB mating 
for the challenging Solid State Lighting (SSL) market. These connectors needed to be 
small, low in height, carry up to 5 Amps/contact, and then function up to 125°C for 
extended periods. This application has been very unique to the SSL market where 
PCB’s are stacked end-to-end to create linear strip lighting in everything from office to 
transportation applications.
The IDC cable plug connector allows for 22-24AWG discrete or cabled wires to be 
easily and reliably terminated into a 9159 standard interface socket connector. This 
will allow power and signals to be connected onto a PCB socket connector while 
providing positive latching. The wire assembly support block allows for 2 through 6 
wires to be terminated all in one step with any standard bench top press. IDC covers 
provide both through (daisy chain applications) and wire stop termination options.

APPLICATIONS
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
ELECTRICAL
ENVIRONMENTAL
MECHANICAL
The 9159 series of Board-to-Board interconnect system allows two PCB's to be mated 
end-to-end creating strips of LED lighting. Designed specifically for the unique Solid 
State Lighting (SSL) market requiring coplanar (horizontal-to-horizontal) PCB mating 
with a 5 Amp current rating in the smallest package available. The top loading socket 
allows complete PCB’s to be replaced in the field without having to dissemble the 
entire strip of boards. The connector has a two part insulator whereby the top of the 
connector will slide open allowing the plug connector to be pulled out either vertically 
or at a slight angle. Once the PCB is replaced, the cover is slid back like a Zero 
Insertion Force (ZIF) connector to the closed position. The PCB layout is identical to 
the standard horizontal socket to maintain family commonality at the PCB level.

ZHAGA BOOK 18 / Z10 
STREET LIGHT CONNECTORS:
REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF STREET LIGHTING ARCHITECTURE
TE Connectivity (TE)’s LUMAWISE Endurance S Connector System is a complete set of products specially 
designed for street and area lighting. There are two main offerings. The original Endurance S Zhaga Book 18 
connector system enables D4i controlled Zhaga Book 18 compliant luminaires while the Endurance S Keyed 
Connector System enables non-Book 18 applications like Z10.  
LUMAWISE Endurance S includes a receptacle, mounted to a street or area light fixture, as well as several base 
and domes, that together form a robust enclosure for sensor modules and network lighting control systems. 
The design is compact, UV resistant, IP66 seal rated and can be mounted on the top, bottom or even the side 
of a luminaire, offering flexibility to the designer.
Extending from the Endurance S portfolio is the S2 receptacle. Offered in both Zhaga Book 18 and Z10 
enabled keyed varieties the S2 receptacle introduces a two-wire per contact solution for ease of wiring and 
applied cost savings in luminaires with dual node architecture.
LUMAWISE ENDURANCE S CONNECTORS 
HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AS A STAND-
ALONE SYSTEM AND CAN BE USED IN 
A COMPLEMENTARY FUNCTION AS AN 
AUXILIARY SENSOR MODULE WHEN 
ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY IS REQUIRED 
IN ANSI/NEMA BASED LIGHTING FIXTURES. 
INSTALLATION IS EASY AND FAST. PUSH-
AND-TWIST WITH ONE HAND LOCKING 
DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY SPECIAL TOOLS.
