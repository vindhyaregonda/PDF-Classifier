157T Series
Standard Nano2® Fuse and Clip Assembly
Description
The 157T Series Fuse/Clip assembly is a small, square, Time-Lag, 
surface mount fuse that is assembled in surface mountable fuse 
clips.  The unique time delay feature of this fuse design helps 
solve the problem of nuisance “opening” by accommodating 
inrush currents that normally cause a fast-acting fuse to open.
The fuse clip and pre-installed fuse combination can be 
automatically placed in PC Board in one efficient manufacturing 
operation. It permits quick and easy replacement of fuses without 
performing desoldering process, even in the field and without 
exposing the PC Board to detrimental effects of rework solder 
heat.

NANO2® > 154 OMNI-BLOK® Fuse and Holder Combination
Surface Mount Fuses
154/154T/154L/154TL Series OMNI-BLOK® Fuse and Holder Assembly
Description
The RoHS compliant 154 Series OMNI-BLOK® Fuse and 
Holder Assembly offers a solution for efficient installation 
and easy replacement of miniature Nano2® surface 
mount fuses. Offered in a tape and reel package, this 
fuse and holder combination can be installed on a PC 
board as an efficient single step. Fuse replacement can 
be accomplished without exposing the PC board to the 
detrimental effects of solder heat.
The fuse holder unit may be sold as a stand-alone item, 
shipped in bulk quantity using part number 01550900M 
and also pre-packaged in tape and reel cartridges using part 
number 01550900DR.

Notes: 
1. Cold resistance measured at less than 10% of rated current at 23°C. 
2. Agency Approval Table Key: X=Approved or Certified, P=Pending.
The 160 Series product is a metal fuse clip with pre-
installed Littelfuse 443 Series Fuse. This fuse and clip 
combination can be automatically installed in PC Boards in 
one efficient manufacturing operation. It permits quick and 
easy fuse replacement without exposing the PC Boards 
and other components to risks of rework solder heat as 
required with direct surface mount fuses. 
It is designed to enable compliance with the RoHS 
directive. This product is fully compatible with lead-free 
solder alloy and higher temperature profiles associated 
with lead-free assembly.
Applications
•	 AC/DC power adaptor
•	 Telecom equipment 
system power
•	 Portable system built-in 
AC/DC converter
•	 High voltage DC/DC  
converter
•	 Lighting System
•	 LED Lighting
Specifications are subject to change without notice.  Application testing is strongly recommended.

•   Telecom power supplies 
•   Data center server power supplies 
•   Higher energy and power efficient applications 
The 487 Series is a 420VAC/420VDC rated 5x20mm fast-
acting ceramic body fuse, designed to ensure the best 
coordination between a power supply unit (PSU) and an 
electrical circuit breaker panel during short-circuit and over-
current faults. When installed in a PSU, the 487 series 
fuse opens faster than the circuit breaker and removes 
the problematic PSU while preventing the circuit breaker 
from shutting down other critical systems. With 420VAC 
characteristics, the 487 Series is well suited for high-
energy applications like 3-phase power supplies, inverters, 
and ballasts. With 420VDC characteristics, it is optimal 
for high-voltage DC power grid in data centers, telecom 
applications, and intelligent commercial buildings.
•	 Lower I2t and faster 
tripping 
•	 High current ratings up 
to 20A in a 5x20mm 
footprint 
•	 Rated voltage @ 420VAC, 
420VDC 
•	 Available in cartridge and 
axial leaded versions 
•	 RoHS compliant and

1.
SCOPE
SCOPE
This specification covers inspection methods, procedures and requirements for high-frequency
and controlled electrical cables.
TEMPERATURE RATING
The temperature rating, when shown on the specification sheet, is based on data obtained from
either testing of the insulation material(s) using the mechanical and electrical integrity of the
product as defined by ASTM D 3032, Section 14, as the basis for the rating, or by industry-
defined standards for the type of material.  The temperature rating is not based on possible
changes to the electrical characteristics of the cable which might occur as a result of exposure
to temperature extremes.

•  LMR
®- UltraFlex has a stranded center conductor 
and rubber outer jacket designed for multiple bending/
flexing cycles. It is used for both indoor and outdoor 
applications. 
•  Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR- 
UF cable design. The flexible outer conductor enables 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of 
 
similar size and performance.
•  Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR- 
UF. Size for size LMR has the lowest loss of any flexible 
 
cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line cables.
•  RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
•  Weatherability: LMR-UF cables are designed for 
outdoor exposure and have a life expectancy in excess 
 
of 10 years.
•  Connectors: 
A wide variety of connectors are available 
 
for LMR cable, including all common interface types, 
reverse polarity, and solder-on center pins.  Most LMR 
connectors employ crimp outer attachment using standard 
 
hex crimp sizes.
•  Cable Assemblies: All LMR-UF cable types are 
 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies.  Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details.

• 	LMR
® -75 standard is a UV Resistant Polyethylene 
jacketed cable designed for 20-year service outdoor use. 
 
The bending and handling characteristics are significantly 
 
better than any smooth wall or corrugated hard-line 
cables. 
• 	Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR-
600-75 
cable 
design. 
The 
flexible 
outer 
conductor 
enables 
 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of similar 
 
size and performance.
• 	Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR-600-
75.  Size for size LMR-75 has the lowest loss of any 
flexible cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line 
 
cables.
• 	RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
• 	Weatherability: LMR-600-75 cables designed for 
outdoor exposure incorporate the best materials for UV 
 
resistance and have life expectancy in excess of 20 years.
• 	Connectors: Standard available connectors include 
type-N and type-F male plug with 75 ohm interface. Most 
 
LMR-75 connectors are the EZ install type with crimp 
outer and non-solder center contact attachment.
• 	Cable Assemblies: All LMR-600-75 cable types are 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies. Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details.

The solid outer conductor of the 
corrugated coaxial cable creates 
a continuous RFI/EMI shield that 
minimizes system interference.
The solid inner and outer 
conductors eliminate PIM when 
used with Times Connectors.

This information is provided based on reasonable inquiry of our suppliers and represents our current actual knowledge 
based on the information they provided. This information is subject to change. The part numbers that TE has identified as 
EU RoHS compliant have a maximum concentration of 0.1% by weight in homogenous materials for lead, hexavalent 
chromium, mercury, PBB, PBDE, DBP, BBP, DEHP, DIBP, and 0.01% for cadmium, or qualify for an exemption to these 
limits as defined in the Annexes of Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS2). Finished electrical and electronic equipment products 
will be CE marked as required by Directive 2011/65/EU. Components may not be CE marked. Additionally, the part 
numbers that TE has identified as EU ELV compliant have a maximum concentration of 0.1% by weight in homogenous 
materials for lead, hexavalent chromium, and mercury, and 0.01% for cadmium, or qualify for an exemption to these limits 
as defined in the Annexes of Directive 2000/53/EC (ELV). Regarding the REACH Regulation, the information TE provides
