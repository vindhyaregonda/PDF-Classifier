To determine the most attractive and efficient form of lighting for your application,
begin by selecting the best lamp type, lamp spacing, and wattage. Then design
the system for your specific needs by selecting the right accessories.  
As a general rule, the basic version of our products uses 5-watt lamps 3” on center
and can uniformly illuminate surfaces positioned as close as 2”to 3” from the
fixture. Lamp sockets are designed to be attached with mounting screws, offering
complete flexibility of adjustment in countless directions. These products feature
26,000 hours of rated life and a pleasant 2,4000K color temperature.

The Elite-Engineered LED Module system is much more than just a simple LED retrofit. 
The Elite LED system is a highly engineered work of design and optical science which 
produces over 600 lumens! Our meticulously crafted optics gather the light scattered 
by the LED chip and shape it into a functional beam with uniform light distribution.
DURABILITY
Flame retardant PC body and heat management system are engineered for extremely 
long life and service period. Without proper heat management, any LED luminaire will 
fail. Life tests have shown the Elite RL417 light output will be maintained at 70% of 
initial at 50,000 hours of operation.
REPEATABLE
Repeatability means quality. From our chip selection process, to our driver, to the 
thermal management, the Elite RL417 Module is engineered for quality. All Elite LED 
luminaires are rated at 90+ CRI, as rated and tested to LM-79 and LM-80 standards by 
a certified laboratory. Elite’s highly selective LED chips produce zero ultraviolet and 
virtually no infrared light.
INTERCHANGEABLE
The Elite RL417 LED system fits in most junction boxes.

The low-profile recessed design of the Pathfinder makes it a popular choice for night lighting when the intent is to blend the fixture into the wall. The louver design is engineered to maximize light output with clean 
cut-off, delivering sufficient light to navigate a darkened room but minimizing disruption of a sleeping patient. Dependable LED lighting will provide years of energy-efficient and maintenance-free operation. Choose 
from (3) standard white, amber, blue, or red LED options. An integral photocell (option) may be specified for additional energy efficiency.
Also available with through wall option where second pathfinder (satellite) can be mounted on reverse side of wall and powered by master pathfinder box via low voltage wire.  Satellite pathfinder can be installed up 
to two feet away from master pathfinder.

Night lighting serves an important purpose in a medical facility. For ambulatory patients, sufficient light must be available to safely navigate from the bed to the restroom at night. Caregivers must see a clear path 
from hallway to bed and then have adequate light to observe the patient’s condition, while minimizing disruption of the patient’s sleep. Therefore, intensity and color of the light, as well as fixture placement, must be 
carefully considered. Both the Geo and Oval offer rugged die cast aluminum housings that meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), extending only 1.5” off the wall. Choose from standard warm 
white or optional amber LEDs.

Miniature Low Voltage Trac System
LINEAR LAMPHOLDERS

D3.2.0
Low Voltage T3-1/4 Single Lampholder
Wedge base lampholders are an economical choice for linear lighting applications.  
They have a minimal profile and produce bright, uniform illumination. They have  
stationary aluminum reflectors to forward project more of the 360° light from the lamp.  
They are compatible with wedge base lamps that are 10W or less and T3-1/4 size  
or smaller including xenon, LED, etc. Xenon lamps emit a white light that approximates  
the color of halogen, but have up to a 20,000-hour lamp life and do not require fixture  
lenses or special handling.

The maximum capacity of a fixture must not exceed 20 amps (480 
Watts @ 24 Volts). If a run length exceeds these limitations, then it 
should only be provided by multiple fixtures. Each fixture would then 
require an independent feed running to the transformer. Additionally, 
fixtures using 6” on center are further restricted in size to prevent 
excessive drops in voltage. Please call our technical department for 
more details.

he Mini Round Instant Flexilight, 
3/8” in diameter and rated 
at 35,000 hours, is becoming 
the most popular rope light because 
of its smaller diameter. This design 
has become possible through a 
restructuring of wires and light bulbs 
inside the rope light. Therefore, the 
quality and life of the product has 
remained as high as the standard 1/2” 
rope light. 
The exclusive use of the highest-quality 
PVC material along with UV additives 
makes this product suitable for both 
indoor and outdoor applications, and 
can withstand both freezing and 
scorching weather. Flashing light 
effects can be created if a controller is 
used. The Mini Round Instant Flexilight 
is suitable for making complicated 
patterns and designs with acute angles 
and dense lines. Its flexibility also makes 
it perfect for making smaller designs, 
such as portable signs and small home 
decorations.

he Super-Brite rope light, 5/8” 
in diameter, is made with super-
bright bulbs (6V/100MA). Each 
bulb emits 66.7% higher brightness 
than the standard miniature bulb. Since 
we only use the highest-quality PVC 
material along with UV additives, the 
Super-Brite Flexilight can be used in 
indoor or outdoor applications and can 
withstand both freezing and scorching 
weather. 
Superior brightness makes these rope 
lights perfect for creating highlights in 
decorations. Due to its larger bulbs and 
thickness, Super-Brite is also designed 
for large-scale decorations, such as 
those on a skyscraper, across a bridge, 
or on a large billboard.

APPLICATION: 
Hallways/corridors, office buildings, library stacks, schools, and hospitals.
OPTICS - The OSS-LED uses a frosted acrylic lens to scatter the light emitted from the LED 
chips into functional light. The LED offered in the OSS-LED has the highest return on initial 
investment compared to other standard lighting solutions.
PERFORMANCE - The light engines found in the OSS are rated at 90+ CRI and are available 
in multiple CCTs: 3000K, 4000K and 5000K. Rated and tested to LM-79 and LM-80 standards. 
The LEDs are also binned to a 3-step MacAdam ellipses to achieve consistent color from fixture 
to fixture. 
ELECTRICAL - Powered by high-quality constant-current power LED drivers which are rated for 
50 to 60Hz at 120 or 120-277V input, produce less than 20% THD, and have a power factor 
of .90 to 1.00. 
QUALITY CONTROL - Every fixture is turned on and rigorously tested by our QC Department 
before shipping.
INSTALLATION - Fixture easily mounts directly over a 4” recessed outlet box, and most 
standard size junction boxes. 
WARRANTY - Limited 5 Year Warranty
Note: Actual performance may differ as a result of end-user environment and application. All 
values are design or typical values, measured under laboratory conditions at 25oC. Specifications are 
subject to change without notice.

FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS
INTENDED USE — The BLWP LED Wrap/ Wall bracket expands the BLT family with the features 
and aesthetics of the popular BLT center basket design with a clean, versatile style and volumetric 
distribution. High efficacy LED light engines deliver energy savings and low maintenance compared to 
traditional sources. An extensive selection of configurations and options make the BLWP the perfect 
choice for many lighting applications including schools, offices, stairwells and other commercial spaces. 
With multiple mounting options, easy installation, and controls configurations, the BLWP is an excellent 
choice for renovation and new construction.
BLWP Tunable White is perfect in classrooms and educational settings as it allows the light color 
temperature to be adjusted to the optimal light level for student tasks such as reading or test taking.
CONSTRUCTION — BLWP enclosure components are die-formed for dimensional consistency. For 2' 
and 4' product, hinged door frame allows easy access to electrical components and mounting locations 
without having to remove additional parts. For 8' product, suspension aircraft cables allow easy access to 
electrical components and mounting locations without having to remove additional parts. Available in 
three paint finishes: white (pre-paint), painted after fabrication white, and natural aluminum. Diffusers 
are extruded from impact modified acrylic for increased durability. Optional polycarbonate lens available 
for additional impact resistance, as well as Tamper Proof screws. 
OPTICS — Volumetric illumination is achieved by creating an optimal mix of light to walls, partitions 
and vertical and horizontal work surfaces – rendering the interior space, objects and occupants in a more 
balanced, complimentary luminous environment. High performance extruded acrylic diffusers conceal 
LEDs and efficiently deliver light in a volumetric distribution. Five diffuser choices available - curved and 
square designs with linear prisms, a smooth frosted finish, and a smooth polycarbonate finish.
ELECTRICAL — Long-life LEDs, coupled with high-efficiency drivers, provide superior quantity 
and quality of illumination for extended service life. 80% LED lumen maintenance at 60,000 hours 
(L80/60,000). 
eldoLED driver options deliver choice of dimming range, and choices for control, while assuring flicker-
free, low-current inrush, 89% efficiency and low EMI. 
Integrated nLight®controls make each luminaire addressable — allowing it to digitally communicate 
with other nLight enabled controls such as dimmers, switches, occupancy sensors and photocontrols. 
Simply connect all the nLight enabled control devices and the BLT luminaires using standard Cat-5 
cabling. Unique plug-and-play convenience as devices and luminaires automatically discover each other 
and self-commission.
Driver disconnect provided where required to comply with US and Canadian codes.
Mainstream Dynamic Tunable White with nTune Technology: Tunable white nTune™ is an all digital 
light color temperature control within an nLight enabled luminaire. This brings tunable white lighting 
control into the mainstream with repeatable, consistent results in an economical luminaire form and 
system already familiar to schools. Designers and facility operators are granted the freedom to tie scenes 
to specific activities or to complement colors or materials within a visual environment. nTune™ allows 
color temperature settings through the Productivity Range of 3000K-5000K or 2700K to 6500K (Rhythm 
Range). Refer to the Programming User’s Guide for instructions on customizing to your application with 
SensorView.
Integrated Sensor (nLight Wired Networking): This sensor is nLight-enabled, meaning it has the ability 
to communicate over an nLight network. When wired, using CAT-5 cabling, with other nLight-enabled 
sensors, power packs, or WallPods, an nLight control zone is created. Once linked to a Gateway, directly or 
via a Bridge, the zone becomes capable of remote status monitoring and control via SensorView software.  
See page 2 for the nLight sensor options.
INSTALLATION — Intended for surface or suspend mounting. For row mounting and quick mounting to 
junction boxes see accessories section. Suitable for damp location.
LISTINGS — CSA Certified to meet U.S. and Canadian standards. DesignLights Consortium® (DLC) 
qualified product. Not all versions of this product may be DLC qualified. Please check the DLC Qualified 
Products List at www.designlights.org/QPL to confirm which versions are qualified.

FEATURES
The RL431 is the newest, most efficient, and advanced LED retrofit
modules from ELITE Lighting. It’s unique design delivers color 
quality above a 90 CRI rating. The color matching has never been 
so close, with a binning as low as 3 MacAdams ellipses. The RL431 
LED retrofit meet all new mandatory California Title 24 requirements.
The Elite RL431` LED Module has been engineered for new
constructions to meet Title-24’s ‘No Edison Socket” mandate. The 
Elite LED Module system works in our dedicated (LD4IC-AT, LD4-AT, 
LD4R-AT) housings and our existing 4” incandescent housings (or 
standard B4IC-AT, B4-AT and B4R-AT) but is also suitable for use in 
most 4”recessed downlight housings in the market.
Elite LED Retrofits come standard with quick
connectors ready for installation in Elite Lighting’s 
LD series recessed housing that are Energy Star 
and Title 24 rated (LD4IC-AT, LD5IC, LD6IC-AT). 
INSTALLATION
OPTICS AND REFLECTOR
The Elite-Engineered LED Module system is much more than just 
a simple LED retrofit. The Elite LED system is a highly engineered 
work of design and optical science which produces over 900 
lumens. Our meticulously crafted optics gather the light scattered 
by the LED chip and shape it into a functional beam with uniform 
light distribution. The baffle also offers the benefits of a smooth 
integrated light with glare reduction at a 55 degree cut-off, which 
minimizes brightness.

DESCRIPTION
 
  Offering a slender profile that is easy to assemble and customize, Flexrail™™
integrates art and technology into a flexible line voltage system bendable in the

fixtures. Unlike conventional monorail systems with bulky transformers,
Flexrail™™ can be powered directly through a junction box or 120V source. A
single circuit of Flexrail™ can accommodate dozens of LED pendants or rail
heads. This sturdy, yet distinctive system is engineered for the most demanding
residential, retail, or commercial applications where versatility, high
performance and robust aesthetics are necessary.

LF Illumination’s new                            warm dimming allows the features of warm 
dimming technology to be installed in fixtures and price points once thought impossible.
The small footprint LED COB design uses many of our standard subassembly components 
and is compatible with virtually all standard dimming protocols currently available.
The LED itself maintains 95CRI typ (92CRI min) across the usable CCT range of 3000K 
to 1800K and dims down to around 2% visible light output.

Catalog  
Number
Notes
Type
FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS
INTENDED USE — Quick Ship orders ship in 17 days, to meet a maximum 21 day delivery time.
Square Straight Steel is a general purpose light pole for up to 25-foot mounting heights. This pole provides a robust yet cost 
effective option for mounting area lights and floodlights. 
CONSTRUCTION — 
Pole Shaft: The pole shaft is of uniform dimension and wall thickness and is made of a weldable-grade, hot-rolled, 
commercial-quality steel tubing with a minimum yield of 55 KSI (11-gauge, .12""), or 50 KSI (7-gauge, .18""). Shaft is one-piece 
with a full-length longitudinal high-frequency electric resistance weld. Uniformly square in cross-section with flat sides, small 
corner radii and excellent torsional qualities. Available shaft widths are 4"" and 5"".
Pole Top: Options include tenon top, drilled for side mount fixture, tenon with drilling (includes extra handhole) and open 
top. Side drilled and open top poles include a removable top cap.. 
Handhole: A reinforced handhole with grounding provision is provided at 18"" from the base on side A. Every handhole 
includes a cover and cover attachment hardware. The handhole has a nominal dimension of 2.5"" x 5"".
Base Cover: A color matched durable ABS plastic two-piece full base cover, is provided with each pole assembly. 
Anchor Base/Bolts: Anchor base is fabricated from steel that meets ASTM A36 standards. Anchor bolts are manufactured 
to ASTM F1554 Standards grade 55, (55 KSI minimum yield strength and tensile strength of 75-95 KSI). Top threaded portion 
(nominal 12"") is hot-dipped galvanized per ASTM A-153.  
HARDWARE — All structural fasteners are high-strength galvanized carbon steel. All non-structural fasteners are galvanized 
or zinc-plated carbon steel or stainless steel.
FINISH — Exterior parts are protected by a TGIC or Urethane polyester powder coat finish that provides superior resistance 
to corrosion and weathering. A tightly controlled multi-stage process ensures superior adhesion as well as a minimum finish 
thickness of 3 mils. Extra durable standard powder-coat finishes include Dark Bronze, Black and Natural Aluminum colors.
GOVERNEMENT PROCUREMENT —
BAA – Buy America(n) Act: Product qualifies as a domestic end product under the Buy American Act as implemented in 
the FAR and DFARS. Product also qualifies as manufactured in the United States under DOT Buy America regulations.
