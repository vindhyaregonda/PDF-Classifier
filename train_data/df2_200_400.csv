DESCRIPTION
 
  Offering a slender profile that is easy to assemble and customize, Flexrail™™
integrates art and technology into a flexible line voltage system bendable in the
field to navigate curves for endless design possibilities. The flexible upgrade to
traditional track creates bold, eye-catching three dimensional configurations
while challenging ceilings are transformed into dramatic scenes with selections
from hundreds of low and line voltage LED Quick Connect™ pendants and
fixtures. Unlike conventional monorail systems with bulky transformers,
Flexrail™™ can be powered directly through a junction box or 120V source. A
single circuit of Flexrail™ can accommodate dozens of LED pendants or rail
heads. This sturdy, yet distinctive system is engineered for the most demanding
residential, retail, or commercial applications where versatility, high
performance and robust aesthetics are necessary.
 
FEATURES
 
• Supports rail for flat ceilings and surfaces
• 5 year warranty

FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS
INTENDED USE — A general purpose and energy-efficient surface-mounted or suspended LED fixture, 
suitable for wet, damp and/or cold locations. For vapor-tight demanding environments where moisture or 
dust is a concern and where relatively low fixture mounting heights and wide fixture spacing are common. Not 
for use or installation in direct outdoor sunlight. Must be installed under canopy or covered ceiling. For direct 
sunlight installations, please refer to the FEX product family. Typical applications include industrial facilities, 
parking garages, retail malls, multi-purpose rooms, garden centers, and food processing. Certain airborne 
contaminants can diminish the integrity of acrylic and/or polycarbonate. Click here for Acrylic-
Polycarbonate Compatibility table for suitable use.
Certain airborne contaminants may adversely affect the functioning of LEDs and other elec-
tronic components, depending on various factors such as concentrations of the contaminants, 
ventilation, and temperature at the end-user location. Click here for a list of substances that 
may not be suitable for interaction with LEDs and other electronic components.
CONSTRUCTION — One-piece 5VA fiberglass housing with integral perimeter channel utilizing continuous 
poured-in-place NEMA 4X gasket. Approved for through wiring. Captive polymeric latches are standard. 
Stainless steel latches (#316) available as an option for food processing or more demanding applications.
Power connection is easily accomplished through pre-drilled holes. 
OPTICS — Injection molded, acrylic lens (.080"" thick) provides high impact-resistance comparable to 100% 
DR. A UV stabilized polycarbonate diffuser is available (.080"" thick) in clear or frosted for additional impact 
strength where vandal protection is desired. 
Expected service life of 60,000 hours at 80% lumen maintenance (L80); predicted life of more than 100,000 
hours.
ELECTRICAL — Utilizes high-efficiency LEDs mounted to core circuit boards. High-efficiency drivers 
operate 120-277 (MVOLT) and 347-480 (HVOLT) offered with 0-10 volt dimming, dims to 10%. Standard 
Luminaire Surge Protection Level: 6kV/3kA Surge Rated per ANSI C82.77-5-2015. 
INSTALLATION — A pair of stainless steel surface mount brackets (SMB) are included (unless another 
mounting option is chosen) allowing for surface (ceiling) or suspension mount applications using included 
bail with aircraft cable or chain. Optional pair of dual pendant mount brackets (DPMB) are available for sur-

Typical Applications
Description
The PHG LED luminaire is designed for light industrial applications 
where environments are less extreme, but comfortable, uniform 
lighting and dependable performance are still highly desired. Typical 
applications include manufacturing, warehouses, automotive, retail, 
food storage and gymnasiums. Certain airborne contaminants can 
diminish the integrity of acrylic and/or polycarbonate. Click here 
for Acrylic-Polycarbonate Compatibility table for suitable 
uses.
Certain airborne contaminants may adversely affect the functioning 
of LEDs and other electronic components, depending on various 
factors such as concentrations of the contaminants, ventilation, 
and temperature at the end-user location. Click here for a list of 
substances that may not be suitable for interaction with 
LEDs and other electronic components.
Optics
•	 One-piece prismatic borosilicate glass reflector and refractor offer 
the highest levels of uniformity and glare-free performance in 
its class. Refractor protects LEDs from unwanted dust, helping to 
maintain delivered lumens. 
•	 Borosilicate glass won't fade and offer the highest levels of 
luminosity over time.
•	 IP65 rated refractor protects LEDs from unwanted dust helps 
maintain delivered lumens.
•	 Prismatic acrylic available for food storage areas or where glass is 
not preferred.
•	 Prismpack® optic: Prismatic borosilicate optic with sealed 
aluminum cover to minimize dirt accumulation and improve 
optical efficiency. Use when uplight is not desired or required.
Mechanical
•	 Hands free wiring design allows for quick and easy installations.
•	 Open ventilated design naturally pulls heat up and away from 
luminaire, extending the life of critical components.
•	 Robust cast aluminum heat sink (0.6% CU content) and 
offset aluminum electrical compartment maximize thermal 
performance.
•	 Super durable TGIC thermoset powder coat finish provides 1500 
hours salt fog rating.
Electrical
•	 0-10V dimming driver is standard. Dims to 10%.
•	 Fault-tolerant LED light engine.
•	 XVOLT is an optional robust driver solution designed to assist 
with power quality issues and a dropped neutral in 277V input as 
derived from 480V Wye. Supports 277-480V; 6kV surge rated.
•	 Standard Surge Protection Level: Designed to withstand up to 
6kV/3kA per ANSI C82.77-5-2015.
•	 Optional Surge Protection Level: Designed to withstand up to 
10kV/10kA per ANSI C82.77-5-2015, provided when ordered with 
any controls, emergency battery or when SPD is specified in the 
nomenclature.
•	 CCT: 3000K, 3500K, 4000K, 5000K.
•	 CRI: 70CRI, 80CRI & 90CRI.
•	 Dynamic temperature sensing is standard to protect the electronic 
components in the event the maximum operating ambient 
temperature is exceeded.
Wireless Networking
nLight® AIR is the ideal solution for retrofit or new construction 
spaces where additional wiring can be labor intensive. It is available 
with or without an integral sensor. Integrated smart sensors or 
dimming and switching modules must be part of each luminaire in 
the nLight Air network, which can be grouped to control multiple 
luminaires. It pairs to other luminaires and wall switches through 
our mobile app. CLAIRITY PRO, which allows for simple sensor 
adjustment. The granularity of control with the digital PIR occupancy 
detection and daylight sensing makes this a great solution for any 
application.
