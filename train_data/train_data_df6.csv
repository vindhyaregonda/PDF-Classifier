To determine the most attractive and efficient form of lighting for your application,
begin by selecting the best lamp type, lamp spacing, and wattage. Then design
the system for your specific needs by selecting the right accessories.  
As a general rule, the basic version of our products uses 5-watt lamps 3” on center
and can uniformly illuminate surfaces positioned as close as 2”to 3” from the
fixture. Lamp sockets are designed to be attached with mounting screws, offering
complete flexibility of adjustment in countless directions. These products feature
26,000 hours of rated life and a pleasant 2,4000K color temperature.

The Elite-Engineered LED Module system is much more than just a simple LED retrofit. 
The Elite LED system is a highly engineered work of design and optical science which 
produces over 600 lumens! Our meticulously crafted optics gather the light scattered 
by the LED chip and shape it into a functional beam with uniform light distribution.
DURABILITY
Flame retardant PC body and heat management system are engineered for extremely 
long life and service period. Without proper heat management, any LED luminaire will 
fail. Life tests have shown the Elite RL417 light output will be maintained at 70% of 
initial at 50,000 hours of operation.
REPEATABLE
Repeatability means quality. From our chip selection process, to our driver, to the 
thermal management, the Elite RL417 Module is engineered for quality. All Elite LED 
luminaires are rated at 90+ CRI, as rated and tested to LM-79 and LM-80 standards by 
a certified laboratory. Elite’s highly selective LED chips produce zero ultraviolet and 
virtually no infrared light.
INTERCHANGEABLE
The Elite RL417 LED system fits in most junction boxes.

The low-profile recessed design of the Pathfinder makes it a popular choice for night lighting when the intent is to blend the fixture into the wall. The louver design is engineered to maximize light output with clean 
cut-off, delivering sufficient light to navigate a darkened room but minimizing disruption of a sleeping patient. Dependable LED lighting will provide years of energy-efficient and maintenance-free operation. Choose 
from (3) standard white, amber, blue, or red LED options. An integral photocell (option) may be specified for additional energy efficiency.
Also available with through wall option where second pathfinder (satellite) can be mounted on reverse side of wall and powered by master pathfinder box via low voltage wire.  Satellite pathfinder can be installed up 
to two feet away from master pathfinder.

Night lighting serves an important purpose in a medical facility. For ambulatory patients, sufficient light must be available to safely navigate from the bed to the restroom at night. Caregivers must see a clear path 
from hallway to bed and then have adequate light to observe the patient’s condition, while minimizing disruption of the patient’s sleep. Therefore, intensity and color of the light, as well as fixture placement, must be 
carefully considered. Both the Geo and Oval offer rugged die cast aluminum housings that meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), extending only 1.5” off the wall. Choose from standard warm 
white or optional amber LEDs.

Miniature Low Voltage Trac System
LINEAR LAMPHOLDERS

D3.2.0
Low Voltage T3-1/4 Single Lampholder
Wedge base lampholders are an economical choice for linear lighting applications.  
They have a minimal profile and produce bright, uniform illumination. They have  
stationary aluminum reflectors to forward project more of the 360° light from the lamp.  
They are compatible with wedge base lamps that are 10W or less and T3-1/4 size  
or smaller including xenon, LED, etc. Xenon lamps emit a white light that approximates  
the color of halogen, but have up to a 20,000-hour lamp life and do not require fixture  
lenses or special handling.

The maximum capacity of a fixture must not exceed 20 amps (480 
Watts @ 24 Volts). If a run length exceeds these limitations, then it 
should only be provided by multiple fixtures. Each fixture would then 
require an independent feed running to the transformer. Additionally, 
fixtures using 6” on center are further restricted in size to prevent 
excessive drops in voltage. Please call our technical department for 
more details.

he Mini Round Instant Flexilight, 
3/8” in diameter and rated 
at 35,000 hours, is becoming 
the most popular rope light because 
of its smaller diameter. This design 
has become possible through a 
restructuring of wires and light bulbs 
inside the rope light. Therefore, the 
quality and life of the product has 
remained as high as the standard 1/2” 
rope light. 
The exclusive use of the highest-quality 
PVC material along with UV additives 
makes this product suitable for both 
indoor and outdoor applications, and 
can withstand both freezing and 
scorching weather. Flashing light 
effects can be created if a controller is 
used. The Mini Round Instant Flexilight 
is suitable for making complicated 
patterns and designs with acute angles 
and dense lines. Its flexibility also makes 
it perfect for making smaller designs, 
such as portable signs and small home 
decorations.

he Super-Brite rope light, 5/8” 
in diameter, is made with super-
bright bulbs (6V/100MA). Each 
bulb emits 66.7% higher brightness 
than the standard miniature bulb. Since 
we only use the highest-quality PVC 
material along with UV additives, the 
Super-Brite Flexilight can be used in 
indoor or outdoor applications and can 
withstand both freezing and scorching 
weather. 
Superior brightness makes these rope 
lights perfect for creating highlights in 
decorations. Due to its larger bulbs and 
thickness, Super-Brite is also designed 
for large-scale decorations, such as 
those on a skyscraper, across a bridge, 
or on a large billboard.

APPLICATION: 
Hallways/corridors, office buildings, library stacks, schools, and hospitals.
OPTICS - The OSS-LED uses a frosted acrylic lens to scatter the light emitted from the LED 
chips into functional light. The LED offered in the OSS-LED has the highest return on initial 
investment compared to other standard lighting solutions.
PERFORMANCE - The light engines found in the OSS are rated at 90+ CRI and are available 
in multiple CCTs: 3000K, 4000K and 5000K. Rated and tested to LM-79 and LM-80 standards. 
The LEDs are also binned to a 3-step MacAdam ellipses to achieve consistent color from fixture 
to fixture. 
ELECTRICAL - Powered by high-quality constant-current power LED drivers which are rated for 
50 to 60Hz at 120 or 120-277V input, produce less than 20% THD, and have a power factor 
of .90 to 1.00. 
QUALITY CONTROL - Every fixture is turned on and rigorously tested by our QC Department 
before shipping.
INSTALLATION - Fixture easily mounts directly over a 4” recessed outlet box, and most 
standard size junction boxes. 
WARRANTY - Limited 5 Year Warranty
Note: Actual performance may differ as a result of end-user environment and application. All 
values are design or typical values, measured under laboratory conditions at 25oC. Specifications are 
subject to change without notice.

FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS
INTENDED USE — The BLWP LED Wrap/ Wall bracket expands the BLT family with the features 
and aesthetics of the popular BLT center basket design with a clean, versatile style and volumetric 
distribution. High efficacy LED light engines deliver energy savings and low maintenance compared to 
traditional sources. An extensive selection of configurations and options make the BLWP the perfect 
choice for many lighting applications including schools, offices, stairwells and other commercial spaces. 
With multiple mounting options, easy installation, and controls configurations, the BLWP is an excellent 
choice for renovation and new construction.
BLWP Tunable White is perfect in classrooms and educational settings as it allows the light color 
temperature to be adjusted to the optimal light level for student tasks such as reading or test taking.
CONSTRUCTION — BLWP enclosure components are die-formed for dimensional consistency. For 2' 
and 4' product, hinged door frame allows easy access to electrical components and mounting locations 
without having to remove additional parts. For 8' product, suspension aircraft cables allow easy access to 
electrical components and mounting locations without having to remove additional parts. Available in 
three paint finishes: white (pre-paint), painted after fabrication white, and natural aluminum. Diffusers 
are extruded from impact modified acrylic for increased durability. Optional polycarbonate lens available 
for additional impact resistance, as well as Tamper Proof screws. 
OPTICS — Volumetric illumination is achieved by creating an optimal mix of light to walls, partitions 
and vertical and horizontal work surfaces – rendering the interior space, objects and occupants in a more 
balanced, complimentary luminous environment. High performance extruded acrylic diffusers conceal 
LEDs and efficiently deliver light in a volumetric distribution. Five diffuser choices available - curved and 
square designs with linear prisms, a smooth frosted finish, and a smooth polycarbonate finish.
ELECTRICAL — Long-life LEDs, coupled with high-efficiency drivers, provide superior quantity 
and quality of illumination for extended service life. 80% LED lumen maintenance at 60,000 hours 
(L80/60,000). 
eldoLED driver options deliver choice of dimming range, and choices for control, while assuring flicker-
free, low-current inrush, 89% efficiency and low EMI. 
Integrated nLight®controls make each luminaire addressable — allowing it to digitally communicate 
with other nLight enabled controls such as dimmers, switches, occupancy sensors and photocontrols. 
Simply connect all the nLight enabled control devices and the BLT luminaires using standard Cat-5 
cabling. Unique plug-and-play convenience as devices and luminaires automatically discover each other 
and self-commission.
Driver disconnect provided where required to comply with US and Canadian codes.
Mainstream Dynamic Tunable White with nTune Technology: Tunable white nTune™ is an all digital 
light color temperature control within an nLight enabled luminaire. This brings tunable white lighting 
control into the mainstream with repeatable, consistent results in an economical luminaire form and 
system already familiar to schools. Designers and facility operators are granted the freedom to tie scenes 
to specific activities or to complement colors or materials within a visual environment. nTune™ allows 
color temperature settings through the Productivity Range of 3000K-5000K or 2700K to 6500K (Rhythm 
Range). Refer to the Programming User’s Guide for instructions on customizing to your application with 
SensorView.
Integrated Sensor (nLight Wired Networking): This sensor is nLight-enabled, meaning it has the ability 
to communicate over an nLight network. When wired, using CAT-5 cabling, with other nLight-enabled 
sensors, power packs, or WallPods, an nLight control zone is created. Once linked to a Gateway, directly or 
via a Bridge, the zone becomes capable of remote status monitoring and control via SensorView software.  
See page 2 for the nLight sensor options.
INSTALLATION — Intended for surface or suspend mounting. For row mounting and quick mounting to 
junction boxes see accessories section. Suitable for damp location.
LISTINGS — CSA Certified to meet U.S. and Canadian standards. DesignLights Consortium® (DLC) 
qualified product. Not all versions of this product may be DLC qualified. Please check the DLC Qualified 
Products List at www.designlights.org/QPL to confirm which versions are qualified.

FEATURES
The RL431 is the newest, most efficient, and advanced LED retrofit
modules from ELITE Lighting. It’s unique design delivers color 
quality above a 90 CRI rating. The color matching has never been 
so close, with a binning as low as 3 MacAdams ellipses. The RL431 
LED retrofit meet all new mandatory California Title 24 requirements.
The Elite RL431` LED Module has been engineered for new
constructions to meet Title-24’s ‘No Edison Socket” mandate. The 
Elite LED Module system works in our dedicated (LD4IC-AT, LD4-AT, 
LD4R-AT) housings and our existing 4” incandescent housings (or 
standard B4IC-AT, B4-AT and B4R-AT) but is also suitable for use in 
most 4”recessed downlight housings in the market.
Elite LED Retrofits come standard with quick
connectors ready for installation in Elite Lighting’s 
LD series recessed housing that are Energy Star 
and Title 24 rated (LD4IC-AT, LD5IC, LD6IC-AT). 
INSTALLATION
OPTICS AND REFLECTOR
The Elite-Engineered LED Module system is much more than just 
a simple LED retrofit. The Elite LED system is a highly engineered 
work of design and optical science which produces over 900 
lumens. Our meticulously crafted optics gather the light scattered 
by the LED chip and shape it into a functional beam with uniform 
light distribution. The baffle also offers the benefits of a smooth 
integrated light with glare reduction at a 55 degree cut-off, which 
minimizes brightness.

DESCRIPTION
 
  Offering a slender profile that is easy to assemble and customize, Flexrail™™
integrates art and technology into a flexible line voltage system bendable in the

fixtures. Unlike conventional monorail systems with bulky transformers,
Flexrail™™ can be powered directly through a junction box or 120V source. A
single circuit of Flexrail™ can accommodate dozens of LED pendants or rail
heads. This sturdy, yet distinctive system is engineered for the most demanding
residential, retail, or commercial applications where versatility, high
performance and robust aesthetics are necessary.

LF Illumination’s new                            warm dimming allows the features of warm 
dimming technology to be installed in fixtures and price points once thought impossible.
The small footprint LED COB design uses many of our standard subassembly components 
and is compatible with virtually all standard dimming protocols currently available.
The LED itself maintains 95CRI typ (92CRI min) across the usable CCT range of 3000K 
to 1800K and dims down to around 2% visible light output.

Catalog  
Number
Notes
Type
FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS
INTENDED USE — Quick Ship orders ship in 17 days, to meet a maximum 21 day delivery time.
Square Straight Steel is a general purpose light pole for up to 25-foot mounting heights. This pole provides a robust yet cost 
effective option for mounting area lights and floodlights. 
CONSTRUCTION — 
Pole Shaft: The pole shaft is of uniform dimension and wall thickness and is made of a weldable-grade, hot-rolled, 
commercial-quality steel tubing with a minimum yield of 55 KSI (11-gauge, .12""), or 50 KSI (7-gauge, .18""). Shaft is one-piece 
with a full-length longitudinal high-frequency electric resistance weld. Uniformly square in cross-section with flat sides, small 
corner radii and excellent torsional qualities. Available shaft widths are 4"" and 5"".
Pole Top: Options include tenon top, drilled for side mount fixture, tenon with drilling (includes extra handhole) and open 
top. Side drilled and open top poles include a removable top cap.. 
Handhole: A reinforced handhole with grounding provision is provided at 18"" from the base on side A. Every handhole 
includes a cover and cover attachment hardware. The handhole has a nominal dimension of 2.5"" x 5"".
Base Cover: A color matched durable ABS plastic two-piece full base cover, is provided with each pole assembly. 
Anchor Base/Bolts: Anchor base is fabricated from steel that meets ASTM A36 standards. Anchor bolts are manufactured 
to ASTM F1554 Standards grade 55, (55 KSI minimum yield strength and tensile strength of 75-95 KSI). Top threaded portion 
(nominal 12"") is hot-dipped galvanized per ASTM A-153.  
HARDWARE — All structural fasteners are high-strength galvanized carbon steel. All non-structural fasteners are galvanized 
or zinc-plated carbon steel or stainless steel.
FINISH — Exterior parts are protected by a TGIC or Urethane polyester powder coat finish that provides superior resistance 
to corrosion and weathering. A tightly controlled multi-stage process ensures superior adhesion as well as a minimum finish 
thickness of 3 mils. Extra durable standard powder-coat finishes include Dark Bronze, Black and Natural Aluminum colors.
GOVERNEMENT PROCUREMENT —
BAA – Buy America(n) Act: Product qualifies as a domestic end product under the Buy American Act as implemented in 
the FAR and DFARS. Product also qualifies as manufactured in the United States under DOT Buy America regulations.

DESCRIPTION
 
  Offering a slender profile that is easy to assemble and customize, Flexrail™™
integrates art and technology into a flexible line voltage system bendable in the
field to navigate curves for endless design possibilities. The flexible upgrade to
traditional track creates bold, eye-catching three dimensional configurations
while challenging ceilings are transformed into dramatic scenes with selections
from hundreds of low and line voltage LED Quick Connect™ pendants and
fixtures. Unlike conventional monorail systems with bulky transformers,
Flexrail™™ can be powered directly through a junction box or 120V source. A
single circuit of Flexrail™ can accommodate dozens of LED pendants or rail
heads. This sturdy, yet distinctive system is engineered for the most demanding
residential, retail, or commercial applications where versatility, high
performance and robust aesthetics are necessary.
 
FEATURES
 
• Supports rail for flat ceilings and surfaces
• 5 year warranty

FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS
INTENDED USE — A general purpose and energy-efficient surface-mounted or suspended LED fixture, 
suitable for wet, damp and/or cold locations. For vapor-tight demanding environments where moisture or 
dust is a concern and where relatively low fixture mounting heights and wide fixture spacing are common. Not 
for use or installation in direct outdoor sunlight. Must be installed under canopy or covered ceiling. For direct 
sunlight installations, please refer to the FEX product family. Typical applications include industrial facilities, 
parking garages, retail malls, multi-purpose rooms, garden centers, and food processing. Certain airborne 
contaminants can diminish the integrity of acrylic and/or polycarbonate. Click here for Acrylic-
Polycarbonate Compatibility table for suitable use.
Certain airborne contaminants may adversely affect the functioning of LEDs and other elec-
tronic components, depending on various factors such as concentrations of the contaminants, 
ventilation, and temperature at the end-user location. Click here for a list of substances that 
may not be suitable for interaction with LEDs and other electronic components.

Typical Applications
Description
The PHG LED luminaire is designed for light industrial applications 
where environments are less extreme, but comfortable, uniform 
lighting and dependable performance are still highly desired. Typical 
applications include manufacturing, warehouses, automotive, retail, 
food storage and gymnasiums. Certain airborne contaminants can 
diminish the integrity of acrylic and/or polycarbonate. Click here 
for Acrylic-Polycarbonate Compatibility table for suitable 
uses.
Certain airborne contaminants may adversely affect the functioning 
of LEDs and other electronic components, depending on various 
factors such as concentrations of the contaminants, ventilation, 
and temperature at the end-user location. Click here for a list of 
substances that may not be suitable for interaction with 
LEDs and other electronic components.
Optics
•	 One-piece prismatic borosilicate glass reflector and refractor offer 
the highest levels of uniformity and glare-free performance in 
its class. Refractor protects LEDs from unwanted dust, helping to 
maintain delivered lumens. 
•	 Borosilicate glass won't fade and offer the highest levels of 
luminosity over time.
•	 IP65 rated refractor protects LEDs from unwanted dust helps 
maintain delivered lumens.
•	 Prismatic acrylic available for food storage areas or where glass is 
not preferred.
•	 Prismpack® optic: Prismatic borosilicate optic with sealed 
aluminum cover to minimize dirt accumulation and improve 
optical efficiency. Use when uplight is not desired or required.
Mechanical
•	 Hands free wiring design allows for quick and easy installations.
•	 Open ventilated design naturally pulls heat up and away from 
luminaire, extending the life of critical components.
•	 Robust cast aluminum heat sink (0.6% CU content) and 
offset aluminum electrical compartment maximize thermal 
performance.
•	 Super durable TGIC thermoset powder coat finish provides 1500 
hours salt fog rating.
Electrical
•	 0-10V dimming driver is standard. Dims to 10%.
•	 Fault-tolerant LED light engine.
•	 XVOLT is an optional robust driver solution designed to assist 
with power quality issues and a dropped neutral in 277V input as 
derived from 480V Wye. Supports 277-480V; 6kV surge rated.
•	 Standard Surge Protection Level: Designed to withstand up to 
6kV/3kA per ANSI C82.77-5-2015.
•	 Optional Surge Protection Level: Designed to withstand up to 
10kV/10kA per ANSI C82.77-5-2015, provided when ordered with 
any controls, emergency battery or when SPD is specified in the 
nomenclature.
•	 CCT: 3000K, 3500K, 4000K, 5000K.
•	 CRI: 70CRI, 80CRI & 90CRI.
•	 Dynamic temperature sensing is standard to protect the electronic 
components in the event the maximum operating ambient 
temperature is exceeded.
Wireless Networking
nLight® AIR is the ideal solution for retrofit or new construction 
spaces where additional wiring can be labor intensive. It is available 
with or without an integral sensor. Integrated smart sensors or 
dimming and switching modules must be part of each luminaire in 
the nLight Air network, which can be grouped to control multiple 
luminaires. It pairs to other luminaires and wall switches through 
our mobile app. CLAIRITY PRO, which allows for simple sensor 
adjustment. The granularity of control with the digital PIR occupancy 
detection and daylight sensing makes this a great solution for any 
application.

Introduction
The all new VCPGX LED (Visually Comfortable Parking 
Garage) luminaire is the ultimate solution for parking 
garage applications. The deep recessed lens design of 
VCPGX LED minimizes high angle glare, while its patent 
pending transition zone reduces the contrast ratio between 
the luminaire and the dark ceiling. The dedicated up-light 
module option further reduces this contrast, creating a 
more visually comfortable environment.
The VCPGX LED delivers up to 87% in energy savings 
when replacing 175W metal halide luminaires. With over 
100,000 hour life expectancy (12+ years of 24/7 continuous 
operation), the VCPGX LED luminaire provides significant 
maintenance savings over traditional luminaires.

Introduction
The new RSX LED Area family delivers maximum 
value by providing significant energy savings, long 
life and outstanding photometric performance at an 
affordable price. The RSX4 delivers 40,000 to 70,000 
lumens allowing it to replace up to (2) 1000W HID 
luminaires.
The RSX features an integral universal mounting 
mechanism that allows the luminaire to be mounted 
on most existing drill hole patterns. This “no-drill” 
solution provides significant labor savings. An 
easy-access door on the bottom of mounting arm 
allows for wiring without opening the electrical 
compartment. A mast arm adaptor, adjustable 
integral slipfitter and other mounting configurations 
are available.

Cove
TruGroove cove offers a highly controlled asymmetric light throw, evenly lighting 
the space and ceiling, not the wall and pocket. This creates a smoothly illuminated 
low-glare environment with a ""quiet"" ceiling, free of striations. By adjusting 
installation angles you can determine your distribution, and multiple lumen-
package choices help you direct the right amount of light within your space. 
TruGroove cove now includes AccuRender technology for the highest 
color quality at the highest efficacy.

The Veil Series
Like a thin and delicate piece of fabric, Veil softens, 
warms and enhances light. A flexible, translucent PVC 
membrane provides the shielding that gently scatters 
light to give Veil its superior diffusing qualities.
The almost sky-like light warms the appearance of inte-
rior environments, and with its wide range of standard 
and custom sizes, Veil is able to provide soft volumetric 
illumination for almost any room.

The 3AG Slo-Blo® fuse solves a broad range of application 
requirements while offering reliable performance and cost-
effective circuit protection. 
The fuse catalog number with the suffix “ID” instantly 
identifies itself upon opening by showing a discoloration 
of its glass body. Guesswork and time consuming circuit 
testing are eliminated. This unique design offers the same 
quality performance characteristics as the standard 3AG 
Slo-Blo® Fuse design.

157T Series
Standard Nano2® Fuse and Clip Assembly
Description
The 157T Series Fuse/Clip assembly is a small, square, Time-Lag, 
surface mount fuse that is assembled in surface mountable fuse 
clips.  The unique time delay feature of this fuse design helps 
solve the problem of nuisance “opening” by accommodating 
inrush currents that normally cause a fast-acting fuse to open.
The fuse clip and pre-installed fuse combination can be 
automatically placed in PC Board in one efficient manufacturing 
operation. It permits quick and easy replacement of fuses without 
performing desoldering process, even in the field and without 
exposing the PC Board to detrimental effects of rework solder 
heat.

•   Telecom power supplies 
•   Data center server power supplies 
•   Higher energy and power efficient applications 
The 487 Series is a 420VAC/420VDC rated 5x20mm fast-
acting ceramic body fuse, designed to ensure the best 
coordination between a power supply unit (PSU) and an 
electrical circuit breaker panel during short-circuit and over-
current faults. When installed in a PSU, the 487 series 
fuse opens faster than the circuit breaker and removes 
the problematic PSU while preventing the circuit breaker 
from shutting down other critical systems. With 420VAC 
characteristics, the 487 Series is well suited for high-
energy applications like 3-phase power supplies, inverters, 
and ballasts. With 420VDC characteristics, it is optimal 
for high-voltage DC power grid in data centers, telecom 
applications, and intelligent commercial buildings.
•	 Lower I2t and faster 
tripping 
•	 High current ratings up 
to 20A in a 5x20mm 
footprint 
•	 Rated voltage @ 420VAC,

SCOPE
SCOPE
This specification covers inspection methods, procedures and requirements for high-frequency
and controlled electrical cables.
TEMPERATURE RATING
The temperature rating, when shown on the specification sheet, is based on data obtained from
either testing of the insulation material(s) using the mechanical and electrical integrity of the
product as defined by ASTM D 3032, Section 14, as the basis for the rating, or by industry-
defined standards for the type of material.  The temperature rating is not based on possible
changes to the electrical characteristics of the cable which might occur as a result of exposure
to temperature extremes.

•  LMR
®- UltraFlex has a stranded center conductor 
and rubber outer jacket designed for multiple bending/
flexing cycles. It is used for both indoor and outdoor 
applications. 
•  Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR- 
UF cable design. The flexible outer conductor enables 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of 
 
similar size and performance.
•  Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR- 
UF. Size for size LMR has the lowest loss of any flexible 
 
cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line cables.
•  RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
•  Weatherability: LMR-UF cables are designed for 
outdoor exposure and have a life expectancy in excess 
 
of 10 years.
•  Connectors: 
A wide variety of connectors are available 
 
for LMR cable, including all common interface types, 
reverse polarity, and solder-on center pins.  Most LMR 
connectors employ crimp outer attachment using standard 
 
hex crimp sizes.
•  Cable Assemblies: All LMR-UF cable types are 
 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies.  Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details.

• 	LMR
® -75 standard is a UV Resistant Polyethylene 
jacketed cable designed for 20-year service outdoor use. 
 
The bending and handling characteristics are significantly 
 
better than any smooth wall or corrugated hard-line 
cables. 
• 	Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR-
600-75 
cable 
design. 
The 
flexible 
outer 
conductor 
enables 
 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of similar 
 
size and performance.
• 	Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR-600-
75.  Size for size LMR-75 has the lowest loss of any 
flexible cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line 
 
cables.
• 	RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
• 	Weatherability: LMR-600-75 cables designed for 
outdoor exposure incorporate the best materials for UV 
 
resistance and have life expectancy in excess of 20 years.
• 	Connectors: Standard available connectors include 
type-N and type-F male plug with 75 ohm interface. Most 
 
LMR-75 connectors are the EZ install type with crimp 
outer and non-solder center contact attachment.
• 	Cable Assemblies: All LMR-600-75 cable types are 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies. Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details.

SCOPE
SCOPE
This specification covers inspection methods, procedures and requirements for high-frequency
and controlled electrical cables.
TEMPERATURE RATING
The temperature rating, when shown on the specification sheet, is based on data obtained from
either testing of the insulation material(s) using the mechanical and electrical integrity of the
product as defined by ASTM D 3032, Section 14, as the basis for the rating, or by industry-
defined standards for the type of material.  The temperature rating is not based on possible
changes to the electrical characteristics of the cable which might occur as a result of exposure
to temperature extremes.

• 	LMR
® -75 standard is a UV Resistant Polyethylene 
jacketed cable designed for 20-year service outdoor use. 
 
The bending and handling characteristics are significantly 
 
better than any smooth wall or corrugated hard-line 
cables. 
• 	Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR-
600-75 
cable 
design. 
The 
flexible 
outer 
conductor 
enables 
 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of similar 
 
size and performance.
• 	Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR-600-
75.  Size for size LMR-75 has the lowest loss of any 
flexible cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line 
 
cables.
• 	RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
• 	Weatherability: LMR-600-75 cables designed for 
outdoor exposure incorporate the best materials for UV 
 
resistance and have life expectancy in excess of 20 years.
• 	Connectors: Standard available connectors include 
type-N and type-F male plug with 75 ohm interface. Most 
 
LMR-75 connectors are the EZ install type with crimp 
outer and non-solder center contact attachment.
• 	Cable Assemblies: All LMR-600-75 cable types are 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies. Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details. 
Ideal for…

Application Specification 
114-32054 
05 JAN 15  Rev C
NOTE 
All numerical values are in metric units [with U.S. customary units in brackets]. Dimensions are in millimeters. Unless 
otherwise specified, dimensions have a tolerance of ±0.13 mm and angles have a tolerance of ±2°. Figures and illustrations 
are for identification only and are not drawn to scale.  
1. INTRODUCTION 
This specification covers the Inverted Thru Board Platform for both Card Edge and Poke-In Applications. In 
both cases, power can be routed to the LEDs on a printed circuit (pc) board thru the pc board via these 
connector families. The Card Edge version allows the mating of a LED driver pc board perpendicular to the 
LED pc board. The Poke-In version allows discrete wires ranging from 26 AWG to 18 AWG to poke into the 
bottom of the connector. The low-profile flat top design minimizes interference of the light cone from the 
adjacent LEDs, and provides a convenient pick up location for automated pick-and-place machinery. The 
connectors share a common pc board footprint and are packaged in tape and reel per EIA-481. 
When corresponding with TE Connectivity (TE) Personnel, use the terminology provided in this specification to 
facilitate your inquiries for information. Basic terms and features of this product are provided in Figure 1.

KYOCERA AVX continues to develop unique connectors to fill the gap in the industrial 
market, specifically as it relates to low pin count requirements. The newest addition 
to KYOCERA AVX’s broadening line of one piece card edge connectors is the 2p-6p 
top entry version which complements the bottom entry version released last year. 
This new configuration will allow small perpendicular daughter cards to be plugged in 
from the top side of the main board. The single connector option offers an alternative 
to the more traditional and costly two piece solution.
This small connector is packed with several key features that provide significant 
functionality in a broad range of robust industrial applications. The contact system is 
gold plated for enhanced reliability, signal integrity and full 2A/contact current rating. 
The PCB board opening is dual slotted to accept either a 0.8mm or 1.6mm thick 
daughter card within the same connector body.
HOW TO ORDER
•	 Provides a one piece connector solution for low 
pin count perpendicular PCB mating in industrial 
applications

STRIPT™ or naked contacts have been proven to provide high performance at a lower cost 
structure than traditional insulated connectors. Adding to the list of UL certified contacts 
already on the market from KYOCERA AVX, the new high spring force “C-Clip” designed 
SMT contact can be linked together with a bridging contact to provide ultra-reliability in 
linear BTB connections. In addition to robustness, this three-piece component set absorbs 
mating tolerances between the boards and can handle 20 amps of continuous current.

APPLICATIONS
FEATURES AND BENEFITS

KYOCERA AVX developed the 9159 Series of SMT connectors for co-planar PCB 
mating for the challenging Solid State Lighting (SSL) market. These connectors 
needed to be small, low in height, carry up to 5 Amps/contact, and then function up to 
125°C for extended periods. This application has been very unique to the SSL market 
where PCB’s are stacked end-to-end to create linear strip lighting in everything from 
office to transportation applications.
The IDC cable socket connector allows for 22-24AWG discrete or cabled wires to be 
easily and reliably terminated into a 9159 standard interface plug connector. This will 
allow power and signals to be connected onto a PCB socket connector while providing 
positive latching. The wire assembly support block allows for 2 through 6 wires to be 
terminated all in one step with any standard bench top press. IDC covers provide both 
through (daisy chain applications) and wire stop termination options.

KYOCERA AVX was challenged with increasing the pin count density as well as 
minimizing the size of the existing coplanar BTB card edge connector for linear strip 
lighting. The current product is a 2.0mm with single contacts that straddle the PCB to 
make electrical connection on both the top and bottom side of the board. By simply 
changing the contacts to a double sided configuration (separate contacts for both the 
top and bottom of the PCB), KYOCERA AVX was able to double the pin count in the 
same 2.0mm pitch with minimal to no impact on the electrical performance of the 
connector. Reducing the size of the connector required a complete new design as the 
target was a 4p connector with a total length of 4.0mm. To achieve this, KYOCERA 
AVX removed the end walls and then added a center support/keying rib to pre-align the 
PCB during mating. This rib the then holds the PCB in the proper functional location.
The new family of connectors is available with contact sizes of 4, 6, 8 and 10 positions, 
doubling the current products range. The current rating will be 3A for the 4p and 6p, 
and then drop to 2.5A for the 8p and 10p connector. The connector supports the 
standard 1.6mm PCB thickness.
This new connector provides the highest density to reliably connect two in-line 
PCB’s together in the most cost effective assembled solution. More importantly, the 
increased pin count allows for more flexibility in mixing and matching power and 
signal lines.

/
/ BUCHANAN WIREMATE ITB RELEASABLE POKE-IN CONNECTORS
Inverted Thru-Board (ITB) connectors join the BUCHANAN WireMate family from TE 
Connectivity (TE), specially designed for use in linear and circular LED modules found 
in all sorts of commercial and industrial lighting systems. The unique headers enable 
power delivery from the underside of the PCB and LED arrays, eliminating top-surface 
wire management issues. With their easy-to-use poke-in and wire release features, the 
new connectors help shorten installation time and provide extra flexibility for reuse 
and wire replacement. The reduced profile of the connector takes only 2mm in height 
above the PCB top surface while horizontal wire insertion minimizes space usage 
beneath the PCB. The connectors are modular in design, available for up to five wire 
connections and in different colors to help installers avoid mistakes when inserting 
wires. The connectors conform to the UL 1977 standard for component connectors for 
use in data, signal, control and power applications.

APPLICATIONS
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
ELECTRICAL
ENVIRONMENTAL
MECHANICAL
KYOCERA AVX has developed the 1-Piece bottom entry card edge connector to allow 
a perpendicular PCB to be mated to a top mounted main FR4 or metal core PCB from 
the bottom side. The most popular application on the market is in the LED bulb market 
where the FR4 driver card needs to mate to the top pads on a metal core LED board. 
A unique design feature of the KYOCERA AVX connector is that it allows for both 
a 1.6mm and 0.8mm mating PCB thickness, giving designers flexibility in their PCB 
layout and selection. The additional “Anti-Touch” cap can be ordered pre-assembled 
onto the connector or separately. This component protects an individual for electrical 
contact if the lens comes off or the bulb is broken. This is a UL mandated safety 
requirement.
The connectors offer a range of 2 positions to 6 positions in order to add additional 
functionality in the application design such as color control or specific control lines. 
The connector is UL rated with halogen free material and capable of operating 
temperatures up to 120ºC.

APPLICATIONS
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
ELECTRICAL
ENVIRONMENTAL
MECHANICAL
KYOCERA AVX developed the 9159 Series of SMT connectors for co-planar PCB mating 
for the challenging Solid State Lighting (SSL) market. These connectors needed to be 
small, low in height, carry up to 5 Amps/contact, and then function up to 125°C for 
extended periods. This application has been very unique to the SSL market where 
PCB’s are stacked end-to-end to create linear strip lighting in everything from office to 
transportation applications.
The IDC cable plug connector allows for 22-24AWG discrete or cabled wires to be 
easily and reliably terminated into a 9159 standard interface socket connector. This 
will allow power and signals to be connected onto a PCB socket connector while 
providing positive latching. The wire assembly support block allows for 2 through 6 
wires to be terminated all in one step with any standard bench top press. IDC covers 
provide both through (daisy chain applications) and wire stop termination options.

APPLICATIONS
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
ELECTRICAL
ENVIRONMENTAL
MECHANICAL
The 9159 series of Board-to-Board interconnect system allows two PCB's to be mated 
end-to-end creating strips of LED lighting. Designed specifically for the unique Solid 
State Lighting (SSL) market requiring coplanar (horizontal-to-horizontal) PCB mating 
with a 5 Amp current rating in the smallest package available. The top loading socket 
allows complete PCB’s to be replaced in the field without having to dissemble the 
entire strip of boards. The connector has a two part insulator whereby the top of the 
connector will slide open allowing the plug connector to be pulled out either vertically 
or at a slight angle. Once the PCB is replaced, the cover is slid back like a Zero 
Insertion Force (ZIF) connector to the closed position. The PCB layout is identical to 
the standard horizontal socket to maintain family commonality at the PCB level.

ZHAGA BOOK 18 / Z10 
STREET LIGHT CONNECTORS:
REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF STREET LIGHTING ARCHITECTURE
TE Connectivity (TE)’s LUMAWISE Endurance S Connector System is a complete set of products specially 
designed for street and area lighting. There are two main offerings. The original Endurance S Zhaga Book 18 
connector system enables D4i controlled Zhaga Book 18 compliant luminaires while the Endurance S Keyed 
Connector System enables non-Book 18 applications like Z10.  
LUMAWISE Endurance S includes a receptacle, mounted to a street or area light fixture, as well as several base 
and domes, that together form a robust enclosure for sensor modules and network lighting control systems. 
The design is compact, UV resistant, IP66 seal rated and can be mounted on the top, bottom or even the side 
of a luminaire, offering flexibility to the designer.
Extending from the Endurance S portfolio is the S2 receptacle. Offered in both Zhaga Book 18 and Z10 
enabled keyed varieties the S2 receptacle introduces a two-wire per contact solution for ease of wiring and 
applied cost savings in luminaires with dual node architecture.
LUMAWISE ENDURANCE S CONNECTORS 
HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AS A STAND-
ALONE SYSTEM AND CAN BE USED IN 
A COMPLEMENTARY FUNCTION AS AN 
AUXILIARY SENSOR MODULE WHEN 
ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY IS REQUIRED 
IN ANSI/NEMA BASED LIGHTING FIXTURES. 
INSTALLATION IS EASY AND FAST. PUSH-
AND-TWIST WITH ONE HAND LOCKING 
DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY SPECIAL TOOLS.

 LXM1618-12-4x 
12V 4W CCFL Programmable Inverter Module 
I N T E G R A T E D  P R O D U C T S
 
D E S C R I P T I O N  
 
The LXM1618-12-4x is a Single 
Output 4W Direct Drive™ CCFL (Cold 
Cathode 
Fluorescent 
Lamp) 
Inverter 
Module specifically designed for driving 
LCD backlight lamps.  It is ideal for 
driving typical 8.4” to 12.1” panels. 
The maximum output current is 
externally programmable over a range of 5 
to 6.5mA in 0.5mA steps to allow the 
inverter to properly match to a wide array 
of LCD panel lamp current specifications. 
The modules are include a dimming input 
that permits brightness control from either 
a DC voltage source, a PWM signal or an 
external potentiometer.   
LXM1618 
modules 
unlike 
the 
LXM1617 series does not provide wide 
range ‘burst’ mode dimming, rather 
dimming is provided by amplitude control 
of the output current waveform,  this limits 
the potential dim range to typically less 
than 5:1. 
For applications not requiring wide 
range dimming, amplitude control results 
in lower ripple on the input supply and 
reduced 
potential 
transient 
noise 
generation.  Many STN type panels are 
particularly 
well 
suited 
for 
current 
amplitude dimming. 
The modules convert DC voltage from 
the system battery or AC adapter directly 
to high frequency, high-voltage waves 
required to ignite and operate CCFL 
lamps. A 5V input inverter is also 
available (LXM1618-05-4x). 
The modules design is based on 
Microsemi’s 
new 
LX1689 
backlight 
controller, which provides a number of 
cost and performance advantages due to 
the controller’s high level of integration.  
Other benefits of this new topology 
are stable fixed-frequency operation, 
secondary-side strike-voltage regulation 
and 
both 
open 
and 
shorted 
lamp 
protection with fault timeout.

• 	LMR
®- UltraFlex has a stranded center conductor 
and rubber outer jacket designed for multiple bending/
flexing cycles. It is used for both indoor and outdoor 
applications. 
• 	Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR- 
UF cable design. The flexible outer conductor enables 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of 
 
similar size and performance.
• 	Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR- 
UF. Size for size LMR has the lowest loss of any flexible 
 
cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line cables.
• 	RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
• 	Weatherability: LMR-UF cables are designed for 
outdoor exposure and have a life expectancy in excess 
 
of 10 years.
• 	Connectors: 
A wide variety of connectors are available 
 
for LMR cable, including all common interface types, 
reverse polarity, and solder-on center pins.  Most LMR 
connectors employ crimp outer attachment using standard 
 
hex crimp sizes.
• 	Cable Assemblies: All LMR-UF cable types are 
 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies.  Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details.

• 	LMR
®- UltraFlex has a stranded center conductor 
and rubber outer jacket designed for multiple bending/
flexing cycles. It is used for both indoor and outdoor 
applications. 
• 	Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR- 
UF cable design. The flexible outer conductor enables 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of 
 
similar size and performance.
• 	Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR- 
UF. Size for size LMR has the lowest loss of any flexible 
 
cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line cables.
• 	RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
• 	Weatherability: LMR-UF cables are designed for 
outdoor exposure and have a life expectancy in excess 
 
of 10 years.
• 	Connectors: 
A wide variety of connectors are available 
 
for LMR cable, including all common interface types, 
reverse polarity, and solder-on center pins.  Most LMR 
connectors employ crimp outer attachment using standard 
 
hex crimp sizes.
• 	Cable Assemblies: All LMR-UF cable types are 
 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies.  Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details.

• 	LMR
® -75 standard is a UV Resistant Polyethylene 
jacketed cable designed for 20-year service outdoor use. 
 
The bending and handling characteristics are significantly 
 
better than any smooth wall or corrugated hard-line 
cables. 
• 	Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR-
600-75 
cable 
design. 
The 
flexible 
outer 
conductor 
enables 
 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of similar 
 
size and performance.
• 	Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR-600-
75.  Size for size LMR-75 has the lowest loss of any 
flexible cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line 
 
cables.
• 	RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
• 	Weatherability: LMR-600-75 cables designed for 
outdoor exposure incorporate the best materials for UV 
 
resistance and have life expectancy in excess of 20 years.
• 	Connectors: Standard available connectors include 
type-N and type-F male plug with 75 ohm interface. Most 
 
LMR-75 connectors are the EZ install type with crimp 
outer and non-solder center contact attachment.
• 	Cable Assemblies: All LMR-600-75 cable types are 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies. Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details. 
Ideal for…
	 •	Video Applications-CCTV, CATV, baseband or broadband
	 •	In-Building Feeder Runs
	 •	Any 75 ohm Wireless Application requiring an easily routed, 
	 	 low loss RF cable

• 	LMR
® -75 standard is a UV Resistant Polyethylene 
jacketed cable designed for 20-year service outdoor use. 
 
The bending and handling characteristics are significantly 
 
better than any smooth wall or corrugated hard-line 
cables. 
• 	Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR-
600-75 
cable 
design. 
The 
flexible 
outer 
conductor 
enables 
 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of similar 
 
size and performance.
• 	Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR-600-
75.  Size for size LMR-75 has the lowest loss of any 
flexible cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line 
 
cables.
• 	RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
• 	Weatherability: LMR-600-75 cables designed for 
outdoor exposure incorporate the best materials for UV 
 
resistance and have life expectancy in excess of 20 years.
• 	Connectors: Standard available connectors include 
type-N and type-F male plug with 75 ohm interface. Most 
 
LMR-75 connectors are the EZ install type with crimp 
outer and non-solder center contact attachment.
• 	Cable Assemblies: All LMR-600-75 cable types are 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies. Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details. 
Ideal for…
	 •	Video Applications-CCTV, CATV, baseband or broadband
	 •	In-Building Feeder Runs
	 •	Any 75 ohm Wireless Application requiring an easily routed, 
	 	 low loss RF cable

 Description 
A small, portable inverter for EL wire. Powers off of 2 AA batteries (not included!), it can drive 1 to 8 feet 
(about 2.5m) of our high-brightness EL wire for 10 hours. There is a button for selecting steady/blink/off 
modes. There's a removable clip on the back. Comes with a 2.5mm pitch female JST connector 
To connect a piece EL wire to this, you'll want a male connector wire 
The EL inverter requires a 'load' to stabilize itself. Do not run the inverter without at least 1 ft of EL 
wire attached! Otherwise the inverter can spike and damage itself 
Like all inverters we've used, the 2000 Hz oscillation is slightly audible. To reduce the squeaking, we 
suggest opening up the case padding it with thick foam tape/weatherstripping. Squirting some hot glue 
around the capacitors may also help. We managed to get it silent this way.

Product ID: 831 
 
Description 
A small, portable inverter for EL wire with an audio input! This inverter has a little microphone 
and will light the connected EL according to the surrounding audio volume. Makes for an easy 
reactive project. 
 
This inverter requires 5V input (it works great with any USB power pack) and it can drive 2-3 
meters (7 to 10 feet) of our high-brightness EL wire OR 1 meter (3 feet) of EL tape OR a 
10cmx10cm piece of EL panel continuously for about 21 hours (off of 4xAA's). 
 
There is a switch for selecting steady/sound/off modes - steady is 'always on'. Comes with a 
single 2.5mm pitch female JST connectors, standard for all the EL wire and tape we carry. You 
can plug any of our EL wire/tape into this inverter directly. To connect a 'raw' piece EL wire to 
this, you'll want a male connector wire 
 
The EL inverter requires a 'load' to stabilize itself. Do not run the inverter without at least 2 ft of 
EL wire attached! Otherwise the inverter can spike and damage itself 
 
Like all inverters we've used, the 2000 Hz oscillation is slightly audible. To reduce the 
squeaking, we suggest opening up the case padding it with thick foam tape/weatherstripping. 
Squirting some hot glue around the capacitors may also help. We managed to get it silent this

CXA Series  CXA-M1112-VJ
DC to AC Inverters
Connector type, Dimming, 7W, For 2 Bulbs
FEATURES
• The CXA-M1112-VJ is an inverter for cold cathode fluorescent 
lamps and features a built-in dimmer.
• Because they employ advanced output current control, fluctua-
tions in input voltage, load, and distributed capacitance have vir-
tually no effect on brightness.
• Output open and short circuit conditions result in no damage, 
heat generation, or other difficulties.
• The CXA-M1112-VJ has an overvoltage protection device and a 
temperature fuse built-in, thereby achieving a safety design.
• An alarm output function mounted on the CXA-M1112-VJ is use-
ful to detect an occurrence of an error in lamps.
• Insulation is simplified due to flat backside surface of board.

FEATURES
• The CXA-K0505-VJL is an inverter for cold cathode fluorescent 
lamps and features a built-in dimmer.
• Because they employ advanced output current control, fluctua-
tions in input voltage, load, and distributed capacitance have vir-
tually no effect on brightness.
• Output open and short circuit conditions result in no damage, 
heat generation, or other difficulties.
• The bottom of the board has a flat structure that facilitates insu-
lation.
• These parts are ultra-thin with a maximum thickness of only 
6.3mm.
• Safe design that includes a built-in overcurrent protection ele-
ment.

CXA Series  CXA-M1212-RJL
DC to AC Inverters
Connector type, Dimming, 5W, For 2 Bulbs
FEATURES
• The CXA-M1212-RJL is an inverter for cold cathode fluorescent 
lamps and features a built-in dimmer.
• Because they employ advanced output current control, fluctua-
tions in input voltage, load, and distributed capacitance have vir-
tually no effect on brightness.
• Output open and short circuit conditions result in no damage, 
heat generation, or other difficulties.
• Safe design that includes a built-in overcurrent protection ele-
ment.
• Insulation is simplified due to flat backside surface of board.

• The CXA-P1212-VJL is an inverter for cold cathode fluorescent
lamps and features a built-in dimmer.
• Because they employ advanced output current control,
fluctuations in input voltage, load, and distributed capacitance
have virtually no effect on brightness.
• Output open and short circuit conditions result in no damage,
heat generation, or other difficulties.
• Safe design that includes a built-in overcurrent protection
element.
• Insulation is simplified due to flat backside surface of board.
• The high-voltage terminal is coated with silicone so as to reduce
a possibility of an occurrence of a defect caused by dust.

DC to AC Inverters
Connector type, Dimming, 8W, For 2 Bulbs
FEATURES
• Optimum one-connector, two-output design for thin liquid crystal 
panel displays.
• This inverter carries a PMW(pulse modulation width) circuit, 
TDK’s unique circuit design.  This allows dimming of lighting over 
a much wider range than is possible using conventional types of 
dimmer circuits.  The type of dimmer control can be selected as 
desired, either voltage control(Vbr:0 to 1.6V) or resistance con-
trol(VR:0 to 10kΩ).
• Built-in overcurrent protection circuit increases safety.
• Monitor brightness is always kept stable since the built-in current 
feedback illumination stabilization circuit compensates for 
inverter input voltage variation(±10%).
• The board backside is free of wiring pattern. Cost reduction and 
simplified mounting are made possible by a design that only 
uses one side of the board.
• Operational safety is increased by the use of two types of insula-
tion for high voltage components.
APPLICATIONS
Various types of color liquid crystal displays, computer touch pan-
els, controllers, medical devices, ATMs, POS terminals, telecom-
munication terminals, microscope monitors, fishdetectors, ticket 
sales machines, amusement arcade machines.

RangeMAX Wide Range Dimming, Single
Output Inverter.  The LXM1611 series of
Direct DriveTM CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluores-
cent Lamp) Inverter Modules are specifically
designed for driving LCD backlight lamps.
Similar to the LXM1610, the LXM1611 ex-
cels in applications where critical parameters
include very wide range dimmability, high
efficiency and reliable fail-safe design in a
small form factor.
Unlike the LXM1610 or any traditional
dimming CCFL inverters, the LXM1611 pro-
vides the designer a vastly superior display
brightness range.  100:1+ brightness range
is achievable with virtually any LCD display.
Our wide range dimming provides excep-
tional display readability at less than 1% of
full brightness, allowing both power savings
and low ambient light operating capability
(i.e. ""night readable"").
The LXM1611 is recommended for use in
panels with low-voltage insulation on the
lamp return wire.
RangeMAX Digital Dimming Tech-
nique.  Digital dimming provides flicker-
free brightness control in any wide-range
dimming application.  Dimming ratios greater
than 100:1 can be achieved.  Incorporation
of a video synchronization feature allows
wide ratio dimming without the display dis-
turbances and interference seen with com-
petitive products.

LXM1611-01
The modules are equipped with a dimming
input that permits brightness control from an
external potentiometer or DC voltage source.
The resultant ""burst drive"" that energizes the
lamp was designed specifically to ensure that
no premature lamp degradation occurs.  (See
""How RangeMAX Works"" Section)
Wide Input Voltage Range.  The mod-
ules convert unregulated DC voltage from the
system battery or AC adapter directly to high-
frequency, high-voltage waves required to
ignite and operate CCFL lamps.
Direct Drive Technology.  The module
design is based on a new Direct Drive topol-
ogy, which provides a number of cost and
performance advantages.  The LXM1611-01
series Direct Drive inverters eliminate the clas-
sic resonant inductor and capacitors, thus
reducing cost and allowing a 30% reduction
in module size.
Additional Features.  Other benefits of
this new topology are fixed-frequency op-
eration and secondary-side strike-voltage
regulation.
Strike-voltage regulation minimizes corona
discharge in the output transformer and re-
lated circuitry, providing longer life and higher
reliability.  All LXM1611 modules feature both
open and shorted lamp protection.
The LXM1611 is fully customizable (elec-
tronically and mechanically) to specific cus-
tomer requirements.

The LXM1626-12-64 is a Dual 6W 
Output Direct Drive™ CCFL (Cold 
Cathode 
Fluorescent 
Lamp) 
Inverter 
Module 
specifically 
designed 
to 
be 
compatible 
with 
the 
Sharp 
LQ150X1LGN2(A),(H), 15” or similar 
dual lamp displays that have both 
individual lamp output connectors on the 
one side of the panel. 
LXM1626 
modules 
provide 
the 
designer with a vastly superior display 
brightness range.  This brightness range is 
achievable with virtually any LCD display.  
The modules are available with a 
dimming input that permits brightness 
control from either, a DC voltage source,  
a PWM signal or external Potentiometer.   
The maximum output current is 
externally programmable (through the 
input connector) over a range of 3.5 to 
5mA in 0.5mA steps.  This allows the 
inverter to match the panel’s lamp current 
specifications, or it can be used to 
purposely drive the lamps at a lower or 
higher current to decrease or increase 
nominal brightness. 
 
RangeMAX 
Digital 
Dimming 
Technique 
provides 
flicker-free 
brightness control in any wide range 
typically (100:1+) dimming application. 
The resultant “burst drive” that 
energizes 
the 
lamp 
is 
designed 
specifically to ensure that no premature 
lamp degradation occurs, while allowing 
significant power savings at lower dim 
levels. 
The modules convert DC voltage from 
the system battery or AC adapter directly 
to high frequency, high-voltage waves 
required to ignite and operate CCFL 
lamps. 
The 
modules 
design 
utilizes 
Microsemi’s LX1691 Enhanced Mult-
mode CCFL backlight controller, which 
provides 
a 
number 
of 
cost 
and 
performance advantages due to the 
controller’s high level of integration.  
Other benefits of this new topology 
are stable fixed-frequency operation, 
secondary-side strike-voltage regulation 
and both open/shorted lamp protection 
with fault timeout.

The LXMG1621 Direct Drive™ CCFL 
(Cold 
Cathode 
Fluorescent 
Lamp) 
Inverter 
Modules 
are 
specifically 
designed for driving two lamp LCD 
backlight displays. 
Similar 
to 
the 
LXMG1620, 
the 
LXMG1621 excels in applications where 
critical parameters include very wide 
range dimmability, high efficiency, and 
reliable fail-safe design in a small form 
factor.  These 12 volt modules are 
specifically designed with desktop and 
industrial applications in mind. 
Unlike 
the 
LXMG1620 
or 
any 
traditional dimming CCFL inverters, the 
LXMG1621 provides the designer a 
vastly superior display brightness range.  
100:1+ brightness range is achievable 
with a standard LCD display (see Product 
Highlight).  Our wide range dimming 
provides exceptional display readability at 
less than 1% of full brightness, allowing 
both power savings and low ambient light 
operating capability(i.e. “night readable”). 
Digital dimming provides flicker-free 
brightness control in any wide-range 
dimming application.   
Incorporation of a video synch-
ronization feature allows wide ratio 
dimming without the display disturbances 
and interference seen with competitive 
products. 
The modules are equipped with a 
dimming input that permits brightness 
control from an external potentiometer or 
DC voltage source.  The resultant “burst 
drive” that energizes the lamp was 
designed specifically to ensure that no 
premature lamp degradation occurs (see 
the “How RangeMAX works” section). 
The module design is based on a new 
Direct Drive topology, which provides a 
number 
of 
cost 
and 
performance 
advantages. 
Microsemi’s multiple lamp inverters 
include a built in connector array for the 
most common LCD lamp configurations. 
Other benefits of this new topology are 
fixed-frequency operation and secondary-
side strike-voltage regulation. 
The LXMG1621 is fully customizable 
(electronically 
and 
mechanically) 
to 
specific customer requirements.

LXMG1618A-12-4x 
12V 4W CCFL Programmable Inverter Module 
TM 
® 
 
D E S C R I P T I O N  
 
The LXMG1618A-12-4x™ is a Single 
Output 4W Direct Drive™ CCFL (Cold 
Cathode 
Fluorescent 
Lamp) 
Inverter 
Module 
designed 
for 
driving 
LCD 
backlight lamps.  It is ideal for driving 
typically 8.4” to 12.1” panels. 
The maximum output current is 
externally programmable over a range of 5 
to 6.5mA in 0.5mA steps (PanelMatch) to 
allow the inverter to properly match to a 
wide array of LCD panel lamp current 
specifications. The modules include a 
dimming input that permits brightness 
control from a DC voltage source, a PWM 
signal or an external potentiometer. 
LXMG1618A modules unlike the 
LXMG1617A series do not provide wide 
range ‘burst’ mode dimming, rather 
dimming is provided by amplitude control 
of the output current waveform, and this 
limits the potential dim range to typically 
less than 5:1. 
The module converts a DC voltage  
from the system battery, or AC adapter 
directly to high frequency, high-voltage 
waveform required to ignite and operate 
CCFL lamps. A 5V input inverter is also 
available (LXMG1618A-05-4x). 
The LXMG1618A modules contain 
the newer highly integrated LX1691B 
CCFL backlight controller IC to provide a 
wider temperature range (-30°C to 80°C) 
compared to the existing solutions offered 
by Microsemi.  
Other benefits of the inverter’s 
topology include stable fixed-frequency 
operation, secondary-side strike voltage 
regulation and both open/shorted lamp 
protection with fault timeout. 
 The new LXMG1618A (“A Series”) 
modules are designed therefore as a 
higher 
performance 
near 
drop-in 
replacement (see BRITE minimum input) 
for those customers and applications 
currently using the LXMG1618 inverters.
