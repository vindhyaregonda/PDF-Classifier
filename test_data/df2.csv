• 	LMR
® -75 standard is a UV Resistant Polyethylene 
jacketed cable designed for 20-year service outdoor use. 
 
The bending and handling characteristics are significantly 
 
better than any smooth wall or corrugated hard-line 
cables. 
• 	Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR-
600-75 
cable 
design. 
The 
flexible 
outer 
conductor 
enables 
 
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of similar 
 
size and performance.
• 	Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR-600-
75.  Size for size LMR-75 has the lowest loss of any 
flexible cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line 
 
cables.
• 	RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer 
 
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 
dB between two adjacent cables). 
• 	Weatherability: LMR-600-75 cables designed for 
outdoor exposure incorporate the best materials for UV 
 
resistance and have life expectancy in excess of 20 years.
• 	Connectors: Standard available connectors include 
type-N and type-F male plug with 75 ohm interface. Most 
 
LMR-75 connectors are the EZ install type with crimp 
outer and non-solder center contact attachment.
• 	Cable Assemblies: All LMR-600-75 cable types are 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies. Refer to 
 
the section on FlexTech for further details. 
Ideal for…
	 •	Video Applications-CCTV, CATV, baseband or broadband
	 •	In-Building Feeder Runs
	 •	Any 75 ohm Wireless Application requiring an easily routed, 
	 	 low loss RF cable

SCOPE
SCOPE
This specification covers inspection methods, procedures and requirements for high-frequency
and controlled electrical cables.
TEMPERATURE RATING
The temperature rating, when shown on the specification sheet, is based on data obtained from
either testing of the insulation material(s) using the mechanical and electrical integrity of the
product as defined by ASTM D 3032, Section 14, as the basis for the rating, or by industry-
defined standards for the type of material.  The temperature rating is not based on possible
changes to the electrical characteristics of the cable which might occur as a result of exposure
to temperature extremes.
