Optical System
Type 3, 4, and 5 distributions 
available. 
LED Thermal Management
The housing design allows the one 
piece housing to provide excellent 
thermal management critical to long 
LED system life.
Infrared Motion Response
Integral IMRI module is a passive 
infrared (PIR) motion sensor 
mounted integral on driver enclosure 
and is available with a sensor lens 
type to accommodate mounting 
heights up to 40’ and occupancy 
coverage area up to 2,800 sq.ft (60’ 
in diameter). Motion response for 
option IMRI is set/operates in the 
following fashion: 
When motion is detected by the PIR 
sensor, the luminaire goes to full 
power/ light output. 
Dimming on low is factory set to 30% 
with 5 minute default in ""full power"" 
prior to dimming back to low. When 
no motion is detected for 5 minutes, 
the motion response system reduces 
the wattage by 70%, to 30% of the 
normal constant wattage reducing 
the light level. 
Mounting
Standard luminaire arm mounts to 
square poles. Round pole adapter 
included with every luminaire 
designed for 4” OD poles.
Energy Saving Benefits 
System efficacy up to 126lms/W with 
significant energy savings over Pulse 
Start Metal Halide luminaires.

Optical Assembly 
The optical assembly is a precisely molded thermal resistant 
borosilicate glass reflector and retractor. The upper portion of this 
system incorporates a series of reflecting prisms that redirect over 
50% of the upward light into the controlling retractor while allowing 
a soft uplight component to define the traditional acorn shape. The 
lower portion uses precisely molded refracting prisms to control the 
distribution of light to maximize utilization, uniformity, and luminaire 
spacing. The top of this assembly is a removable decorative aluminum 
cover with a replica chimney finial for entry into the lamp chamber. 
A total of eight decorative ribs surround the prismatic glass reflector 
and refractor. Three unique optical assemblies are available, designed 
for IES type Ill, type IV, and type V distribution. 
Luminaire Housing 
A decorative leaf style cast aluminum luminaire housing cradles the 
optical assembly and provides an enclosure for the plug-in electrical 
module. The three station incoming line terminal block is prewired 
to a six conductor receptacle for ease in connecting the electrical 
module. A slipfitter will accept a 3 inch high by 2-7/8 inch to 3-1/8 
inch O.D. pipe tenon. 
Electrical Module / Luminaire Housing Door 
The decorative leaf style cast aluminum housing door contains the 
ballast components and is held in place by two captive 1/4-20 stainless 
steel screws. A matching six conductor plug connects to the receptacle 
in the luminaire housing to complete the wiring. 
Electrical Module 
The electronic components are mounted on a steel plate that is 
removable with minimum use of tools. A matching six conductor 
plug connects to the receptacle in the luminaire housing to complete 
the wiring.

HOW 10 USE CAPACITORS FOR MULTI-SPEED BLOWERS 
It is possible to make any ebm blower with a PSC 
motor a multi­
speed blower by adding a second or third capacitor on the load line 
(blue) at or near the value of the motor run capacitor. Actual capacitor 
value and RPM achieved are dependent on the nature of each 
application.

AIRFLOW MEASUREMENT USING 
INSTRUMENTED INLET RINGS

ebm-papst offers a simple airﬂ
 ow measurement technique for backward-curved 
centrifugal fans using modiﬁ
 ed versions of the inlet rings (IR) typically used with 
these fans to maximize performance. The technique is based on the Bernoulli 
and Continuity equations, which allow calculation of ﬂ
 ow through a converging 
nozzle based upon measurement of the static pressure drop across the nozzle.
The applicable equation is of the form Q = 9.36k •    !s / !  • Δ P , where:
 
 
 
 
Q  
=  
airﬂ
 ow in CFM
 
k  
=  
nozzle calibration factor
 
Δ P  
= 
static pressure drop across the nozzle in inches H20
 
!s 
= 
standard air density of .075 lbs/ft3
 
! 
= 
actual air density in lbs/ft3
The calibration factor “k” has been empirically determined for each IR at standard air density of .075 lbs/ft3.  Large variations from 
this air density can effect the measurement and can be taken into account using the !s / ! ratio, otherwise this term can be dropped 
from the equation. 
Two types of instrumented inlet rings are available for each impeller size. One type uses a single pressure tap positioned near the 
discharge end of the IR. The 2nd type uses four pressure taps spaced along the circumference of the IR, connected with tubing 
to form a piezometer ring. The piezometer ring averages the static pressure measurements around the circumference of the IR to 
provide a more accurate ﬂ
 ow measurement in case of uneven pressure distribution around the inlet. In either case, the customer 
connection on the inlet ring is to a single pre-mounted tube connector, suitable for pneumatic tubing with an internal diameter of 
4mm.  This connection should run to the low pressure side of a differential pressure transducer (DPT), while the pressure tap in front 
of the IR is connected to the high pressure side of the DPT.  If the DPT is mounted near the front of the IR but out of the airstream, 
then the high pressure tap on the DPT is suitable and no additional pressure tap is needed."
